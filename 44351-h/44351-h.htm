<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter I</span></span>
<br />A SURPRISE CALL<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob Houston, youthful clerk in the archives
division of the War Department, drew his
topcoat closer about him and shivered as
he stepped out of the shelter of the apartment
house entrance and faced the chill fall rain.</p>
<p>Going back to the office after a full day bent
over a desk was no fun, but a job was a job, and
Bob was thankful for even the small place he
filled in the great machine of government.</p>
<p>The raw, beating rain swept into his face as he
strode down the avenue. A cruising taxicab,
hoping for a passenger, pulled along the curb, but
Bob waved the vehicle away. Just then he had no
extra funds to invest in taxi fare.</p>
<p>The avenue was deserted and Bob doubted if
there would be many at work in the huge building
where the archives division was sheltered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>At the end of a fifteen-minute walk Bob turned
in at the entrance of a hulking gray structure.
The night guard nodded as he recognized Bob
and the clerk stepped through the doorway.</p>
<p>Bob paused in the warmth of the lobby and
shook the water from his coat and hat. Fortunately
he had worn rubbers so his feet were dry
and he felt there was little chance of his catching
cold.</p>
<p>The door behind him opened and a blast of
raw air swirled into the lobby.</p>
<p>Bob turned quickly; then hurried to greet the
newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Uncle Merritt,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
expect to run into you down here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes, one of the crack agents of the
Department of Justice, smiled as he shook the
rain from his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was driving home when I caught a glimpse
of you coming in here. Working tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got at least two hours of work ahead of
me,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone else going to be with you?&rdquo; inquired
his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I want to talk with you where there
is no chance that we may be overheard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was tempted to ask what it was all about,
but he knew that in good time his uncle would
tell him.</p>
<p>They stepped into an automatic elevator and
Bob pressed the control button.</p>
<p>There was a distinct resemblance between
uncle and nephew. Merritt Hughes looked as
though he might be Bob&rsquo;s older brother. He was
well built, about five feet eight inches tall, and
usually tipped the scales at 160 pounds, but there
was no fat on his well conditioned body. His
hair was a dull brown, but the keenness of his
eyes made up for whatever coloring was lacking
in his hair.</p>
<p>Bob was taller than his uncle and would outweigh
him ten pounds. His hair was light and
his pleasant blue eyes were alert to everything
that was going on. Both had rather large and
definite noses, and Bob often chided his uncle on
that family trait.</p>
<p>The elevator stopped at the top floor and they
stepped out. Another guard stopped them and
Bob was forced to present his identification card.
The small golden badge which his uncle displayed
was sufficient to gain his admittance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s desk was in one wing of the archives
division and they made their way there without
loss of time. Bob took his uncle&rsquo;s topcoat and
hung it beside his own. When he turned back
to his desk, his uncle was seated on the other side,
leaning back comfortably in a swivel chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still have the idea you&rsquo;d like to join the bureau
of investigation of the Department of Justice?&rdquo;
asked Merritt Hughes. The question was casual,
almost offhand, and Bob wasn&rsquo;t sure that he had
heard correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding me now,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;You
know I&rsquo;d like to get in the service, but I haven&rsquo;t
a chance. Why, I&rsquo;m not through with my college
work, and they&rsquo;re only taking graduates
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kidding, Bob; I&rsquo;m serious. I think
there may be a chance for you to get in. Of
course you&rsquo;d have to finish your college work
after you were in the department, but that
wouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a handicap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; exulted Bob. &ldquo;Now tell
me what it&rsquo;s all about. The last time I talked to
you about getting in, you gave me about as much
encouragement as though I was suggesting a
swim across the Atlantic ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes was a long time in answering,
and when he finally spoke his voice was so low
that anyone ten feet away would have been unable
to hear his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s trouble and big trouble brewing
right in this department,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know just exactly what is going to happen, but
we must be prepared for any emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob started to speak, but his uncle waved the
words aside and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could plant an agent here, but that might
be too obvious. What we need is someone on the
inside whom we can trust fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, teetering on the edge of his chair, breathlessly
waited for the next words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m counting on you to be the key in the
intrigue that&rsquo;s going on right now in this building,&rdquo;
said Merritt Hughes. &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you can rely on me,&rdquo; said Bob.
&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d do almost anything, take almost any
risk to get into the bureau of investigation of the
Department of Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know you would, Bob, but that isn&rsquo;t going
to be necessary. All I want is someone who will
keep his eyes open, listen to everything that is
said around here, and report to me each night in
detail. You know I wouldn&rsquo;t want you butting
into something where you might get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m young and husky. I can take care of
myself,&rdquo; protested Bob, his eyes reflecting his
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know you can, but after all I&rsquo;ve got
to look out for you. Your mother would never
forgive me if any actual harm came to you while
you were doing a little sleuthing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tender note in the voice of the
agent, for it had devolved upon him to watch
over Bob and his mother after the death of his
sister&rsquo;s husband some six years before. He had
been faithful to the trust and he had no intention
now of placing Bob in any situation where there
would be real jeopardy to his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, go on,&rdquo; urged Bob. &ldquo;Tell me what
I&rsquo;m to watch for and what you suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of answering Merritt Hughes stepped
to the door, opened it, made a careful survey of
the hall, and then drew his chair closer to Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter II</span></span>
<br />AN EMPTY ROOM<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about the new
radio developments which have
been made recently by the War Department?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s surprise was reflected in the look which
flashed across his face. There had been only the
vaguest of rumors that startling radio advancements
had been made by War Department engineers.
It had been only thin talk in the department.
The clerks mentioning it on several occasions
when they had been alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard some talk that rather surprising
advancements have been made,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;but
there has been nothing definite known. Of
course, some of the clerks have been talking
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But no one has any definite information. As
far as you know, the plans have not been filed in
the vaults,&rdquo; Merritt Hughes was pressing hard
for an answer, but Bob could only shake his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This division handles most of the radio data,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but nothing new has been placed in the
vaults here for weeks. I&rsquo;m simply cleaning up
routine stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If new plans and data were filed, you might
handle them,&rdquo; persisted his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite likely, but I wouldn&rsquo;t know the
contents. Everything comes in under seal and
with a key number and only the engineers know
the key and the contents of the sealed package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, you might have a hunch when the
papers are important?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might. There is always talk in the department.
But I would have no way of actually
knowing what was going through my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid of that,&rdquo; admitted his uncle. &ldquo;It
makes things all the harder. If you only knew
when the plans were going through you would
be in a position to use every precaution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t take any chances now,&rdquo; retorted
Bob. &ldquo;Extreme care is used with every single
batch of plans that are sent over by the engineers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that you were careless,
Bob,&rdquo; smiled the Department of Justice agent. &ldquo;I
only meant that if you knew when radio secrets
were going through you could use additional
care and set up extra precautions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be afraid something is going to be
stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what is troubling me,&rdquo; confessed
his uncle, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m afraid that unknowingly
you may be involved. I don&rsquo;t want you to
get caught in a trap if I can help it. That&rsquo;s why
I stopped here tonight. I wanted to have this
talk with you, to warn you that there have been
important discoveries by the engineers and that
they may be through in a few days. From now
on watch every single document that is sent
through your hands. Don&rsquo;t let it out of your
sight from the moment it is delivered to you
until you have filed it and placed it properly in
the vaults. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, his face grave, nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that
nothing like that happens. But who could be
after these new plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, if I could answer that question this problem
would be comparatively simple. The answer
may be right here in this department; again it
may be some outside force that we can only guess
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you working alone on this case?&rdquo; Bob
continued.</p>
<p>A shadow of a frown passed over Merritt
Hughes&rsquo; face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were; I&rsquo;d feel more sure of my
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means Condon Adams is also on the
job,&rdquo; put in Bob, for he knew of the sharp feeling
between his uncle and Adams, another ace operative
of the bureau of investigation. They had
been together on several cases and at every opportunity
Adams had tried to obtain all of the
credit for the successful outcome of their efforts.
He was both unpleasant and ruthless, but he had
a faculty of getting results, and Bob knew that
for this reason alone he was able to retain his position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>The fact that Condon Adams was on the case
placed a different light on it for Bob, for Adams
had a nephew, Tully Ross, who was in the archives
division of the department with Bob.
There was nothing in common between the two
young men. Tully was short of stature, with a
thick chest and short, powerful arms. His eyebrows
were dark and heavy, set close above his
rather small eyes, and his whole face reflected
an innate cruelty that Bob knew must exist. If
Condon Adams was also on the case, it meant
that Tully Ross would be doing his best to help
his uncle for like Bob, Tully was intent upon
getting into the bureau of investigation.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s lips snapped into a thin, firm line. All
right, if that was the way it was to be, he&rsquo;d see
that Tully had a good fight.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes smiled a little grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking about Tully Ross?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Bob nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know what we&rsquo;re up against. It&rsquo;s
two against two and if you and I win I&rsquo;m sure that
I can get you into the bureau. If we don&rsquo;t, then
Tully may go up. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that we&rsquo;re going to win,&rdquo; replied Bob,
and there was stern determination in his words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to feel. Keep up that kind of
spirit and you&rsquo;ll get in the bureau before you
know it. In the meantime, don&rsquo;t let any tricks
get away from you in this routine. Watch every
document that comes into your hands and let me
know at the slightest unusual happening in this
division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll even put eyes in the back of my head,&rdquo;
grinned Bob as his uncle stood up and donned his
topcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will you work tonight?&rdquo; asked
Merritt Hughes as he opened the door which
gave access to the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably two hours; maybe even three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch yourself. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he was gone and Bob was alone in the
high-vaulted room where the rays from the
light on his desk failed to penetrate into the deep
shadows and a strange feeling of premonition
crept over him. For a moment he felt that someone
was watching him and to dispel this feeling
he turned on the glaring top lights.</p>
<p>The room was empty!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter III</span></span>
<br />BOB HAS A VISITOR<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob turned off the top lights and returned to
his desk, which was one of half a dozen
in the long and rather narrow room at
one corner of the building.</p>
<p>As he sat down he could hear the beat of the
rain against the window and looking out could
see, through the curtain of water, the dimmed
lights of the sprawling city. On a clear night the
view was awe-inspiring, but on this night his
only thought was to complete his work and to
return to the warmth and comfort of his own
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Bob delved into the pile of papers which had
accumulated in the wire basket on his desk.
They must be filed and the proper notations
made. There was nothing of especial importance,
or he would not have been working alone for it
was a rule of the division that when documents
of great importance were to be filed, at least two
clerks and usually the chief of the division must
be on hand. Sometimes even armed guards came
in while the filing was taking place for some of
the secrets in the great vaults across the corridor
were worth millions to unscrupulous men and to
other powers.</p>
<p>But until tonight, until his uncle&rsquo;s words had
aroused him, Bob had felt his own work was
rather commonplace. There was nothing in his
life which compared with the excitement and the
almost daily daring of the men in the bureau of
investigation of the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The hours were rather long, the work was
routine and his companions, though pleasant,
were satisfied with their own careers. They were
not looking ahead and dreaming of the day when
they might wear one of the little badges which
identified a Department of Justice agent.</p>
<p>Then Bob realized that he must stop his day
dreaming. Or was it day dreaming after all? His
uncle had said that there was now a possibility
that he might join the department. But this was
no time to ponder about that. He could think of
his future when he returned to his room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Bob went to a filing case which was along the
inside wall of the room and extracted a folder.
Taking it back to his desk he started making
entries of the papers which were on his desk. He
worked slowly but thoroughly, and his handwriting
was clear and definite.</p>
<p>Others might be faster than Bob in the filing
work in the division, but there were none more
accurate and when his work was done the chief
of the division always knew that the task was
well cared for.</p>
<p>Bob worked for more than an hour, stopping
only once or twice to straighten up in his chair,
for it was tiring work going back to the desk after
a full day of the same type of work.</p>
<p>When the file was complete, he returned it to
the case along the wall and sorted the papers
which remained on his desk. They belonged in
four different files and he drew these from the
cases and placed them in a row atop his desk.</p>
<p>The air in the room seemed stuffy and Bob
walked to one of the windows and opened it several
inches&mdash;just enough to let in fresh air, yet
not far enough for the sharp wind to blow rain
into the room. Far below him a car horn
shrieked as an unwary pedestrian tried to beat a
stop light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Bob went back to his desk. Another hour and
his work would be done. He picked up his pen
and resumed the task.</p>
<p>Bob later recalled that he had heard a clock
boom out the hour of nine and it must have been
nearly half an hour later when the door which
led to the corridor opened quietly and a man
stepped inside.</p>
<p>The young clerk, at his desk, was so intent
upon his work that he did not sense there was a
newcomer in the room until the visitor was almost
behind him.</p>
<p>Then Bob swung around with a jerk and recognized
Tully Ross. There was a momentary
flare of anger in Bob&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you come in, make a little noise,&rdquo;
he snapped. &ldquo;I thought a ghost was creeping up
on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of a ghost,&rdquo; retorted Tully,
taking off his topcoat and shaking it vigorously
to get the water off. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you would
be working tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get through this afternoon,&rdquo; replied
Bob, &ldquo;and so much material has been coming
in lately I was afraid that if I let it go another
day I&rsquo;d be swamped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time that happens let me know and I&rsquo;ll
give you a hand,&rdquo; volunteered Tully as he sat
down at his own desk, which was two down
from Bob.</p>
<p>Bob nearly laughed aloud for the thought of
Tully volunteering to help anyone else was almost
fantastic. Each clerk had a special type of
filing and each was not supposed to exchange
work with the other. In this way there was little
chance for the others to know what documents
were going through for permanent filing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Tully, that&rsquo;s nice of you,&rdquo; said Bob,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know what the chief would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d never need to know,&rdquo; said Tully swinging
around in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he did find out that we were helping
each other, we&rsquo;d both be out of a job and I can&rsquo;t
afford to take that kind of a risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither can I right now,&rdquo; conceded Tully,
&ldquo;but I hope to get into something better soon.
This doesn&rsquo;t pay enough for a fellow with my
brains and ability.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit that it doesn&rsquo;t pay a whole lot,&rdquo; replied
Bob, &ldquo;but a fellow has to eat these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;m going to be over in the Department
of Justice,&rdquo; said Tully definitely. &ldquo;It may
not be tomorrow or next week, but I&rsquo;m going to
get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will,&rdquo; agreed Bob. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
the determination to keep at it until you do.&rdquo;
What he failed to add was that Tully&rsquo;s uncle
would do everything in his power to see that
Tully got the promotion and it was no secret that
Condon Adams had powerful political connections
that might be helpful in getting Tully into
the bureau of investigation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter IV</span></span>
<br />THE DOOR MOVES<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Tully was in a talkative mood and at such
times he displayed a pleasing personality.
This was one of those times, but to Bob
it was more than a little irritating for he had work
to do and every minute passed in talking with
Tully meant additional time at his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a funny feeling lately that things
were tightening up in here,&rdquo; said Tully. &ldquo;Even
tonight this room doesn&rsquo;t feel just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wind and the rain,&rdquo; said Bob, looking
up from his work. &ldquo;When the sun is out tomorrow
you&rsquo;ll feel much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Say, Bob, you
haven&rsquo;t heard of anything special breaking?
Something may be coming over from the engineers
that is unusually important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob couldn&rsquo;t honestly say no, so he made an
indefinite answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always talk,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know, but this time it&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;ve
heard that the radio division has made some startling
discoveries that more than one foreign
power would give a few millions to have in its
possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; confessed Tully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
only vague talk; nothing you can put your finger
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought they kept that stuff pretty well
under cover,&rdquo; said Bob, who was determined to
feel out Tully and learn just how much the other
clerk knew. It was evident now that Condon
Adams had been talking to his nephew, probably
telling him in substance much of what Merritt
Hughes had divulged to Bob earlier in the evening
and now Tully was on a fishing expedition
to learn just what Bob knew. Well, two could
play that game and Bob, his head bent over his
work, smiled to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they never advertise the papers they&rsquo;re
sending over for the permanent files,&rdquo; Tully said,
&ldquo;but you know how things get around in the department.
Sometimes we have a pretty good idea
what&rsquo;s going through even though it is all under
seal and in a special code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded, for Tully was right. In spite of
the secrecy which usually surrounded the filing
of important documents, the clerks often knew
what was going through their hands, for even the
walls in Washington seemed to have eyes and
ears and whispers flitted from one department
to another in a mysterious underground manner
which was impossible to stop. Sometimes the
conjecture of the clerks was right; again they
might all be wrong. But it was on such talk as
this that secrets sometimes slipped away and into
the hands of men and women for whom they had
never been intended.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s division, which filed all of the radio
documents, had enjoyed a particularly good
record. The chief, Arthur Jacobs, had been in
charge since before World War days, and he had
used extreme care in the selection of the personnel.
There was yet to come the first major leak
and Bob hoped fervently that it would not happen
while he was in the division.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Tully puttered around his own desk, shoving
papers here and there and obviously making an
effort to appear interested. Once he glanced
sharply at Bob, who was intent on his own work.</p>
<p>Finally Tully stood up and walked to one of
the windows. He gazed out for several minutes
and Bob, glancing up at him, got the impression
that Tully was trying to make up his mind what
to do.</p>
<p>The next thing Bob noticed, Tully was on the
other side of the room, pulling open one of the
filing cases. The floor was carpeted and his steps
from the window to the filing cases had been
noiseless.</p>
<p>There was no rule against a clerk opening one
of the cases, for the documents kept there were
of no major importance. Something in Tully&rsquo;s
attitude caught Bob&rsquo;s attention. Then he realized
that Tully was looking into one of the files which
was under Bob&rsquo;s supervision and there was a
strict rule against that.</p>
<p>Bob hesitated for a moment. It seemed a little
foolish to make an issue over that. Probably
Tully had done it absentmindedly. Then he remembered
his uncle&rsquo;s warning to watch everything
going on in the division.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tully, you&rsquo;re in the wrong file,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Tully turned around quickly, his face flushing
darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm, I guess. I just wondered what
you&rsquo;ve been doing and how you&rsquo;ve been handling
your file. I heard Jacobs complimenting
you the other day and thought I could get some
good pointers by looking your stuff over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, Tully. I&rsquo;ll show you sometime
when Jacobs is here, but you know the rule about
the files. I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to close that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose I don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; snapped Tully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll close it all right,&rdquo; said Bob. His
voice was still calm and even, but there was a
note of warning that Tully dared not ignore.</p>
<p>Bob closed the file on his desk and stood up,
stretching his long, powerful arms. Tully didn&rsquo;t
miss the significance of the motion for Bob had
a well founded reputation as a boxer.</p>
<p>Tully turned back to the filing case and
slammed the steel drawer shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, Pollyanna,&rdquo; he retorted.
&ldquo;That file doesn&rsquo;t look so good after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so it suits Jacobs; that&rsquo;s all that concerns
me,&rdquo; said Bob, sitting down again.</p>
<p>Tully picked up his topcoat to leave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway I don&rsquo;t envy you staying on
here alone tonight. This place is giving me the
creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Tully had departed, Bob was able to
concentrate fully on his own work. A clock
boomed out again, but he was too preoccupied to
count the number of strokes. For all he knew it
might have been ten o&rsquo;clock, or perhaps even
eleven.</p>
<p>A sharp knock at the door disturbed Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard. Just checking up. How long are you
going to be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time in many nights of overtime
work that a guard had ever checked up, but Bob
decided that it might be a new rule placed in
effect without his knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour at least,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Apparently satisfied, the guard moved on and
Bob could hear his footsteps growing fainter as
he bent to his task again.</p>
<p>But he was not to work long uninterruptedly.
The telephone buzzed and there was obvious irritation
in his voice when he answered. But it
vanished when he recognized his uncle&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was a little worried,&rdquo; explained Merritt
Hughes, &ldquo;when I phoned your room and found
you weren&rsquo;t in. Everything all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, except I&rsquo;ve had too many interruptions,&rdquo;
said Bob. Then he hastened to explain.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean you though. Tully Ross was in
and sat around for nearly an hour without doing
anything except making me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he hint at anything?&rdquo; asked Bob&rsquo;s uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The same thing you mentioned. Evidently
Condon Adams has told him about it.
You know Tully wants a position in the bureau
of investigation, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, every youngster in the country would
like it,&rdquo; replied Merritt Hughes. &ldquo;Better stop for
tonight and run along home and get some sleep.
I want you on the alert every hour of the day.
You&rsquo;re in the office from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be through in less than half an hour,&rdquo;
promised Bob. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go directly home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad night and getting worse. Take a
taxi and don&rsquo;t run the risk of catching cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Bob promised to do and with a sigh hung
up the telephone receiver and bent once more to
the task of finishing the filing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>As the hours of the night advanced, the wind
grew colder and Bob arose and closed the window.
The air in the room was now damp and it
would have been easy to allow his mind to run
riot for the building was strangely silent. Noises
from the street, far below, were smothered in the
sound of the rain, driven against the windows.</p>
<p>A slight creak startled Bob and he whirled
toward the door. Even in the dim light which
his desk light cast he could see the handle of the
door moving. Fascinated, he watched. The
handle was moving slowly, as though every effort
was being made to guard against any possible
noise. Bob remained motionless in his chair
as though he had suddenly turned to stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter V</span></span>
<br />A SLIVER OF STEEL<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>The time seemed endless. Actually it
could only have been seconds that Bob
sat there watching the turning of the
doorknob. Then the knob started back. Unseen
fingers had learned what they wanted to know.
The door was not locked.</p>
<p>Through the hulking building there seemed
no sound except Bob&rsquo;s own strained breathing.
In the corridor it was as quiet as in the room, yet
someone must be outside the door, testing the
lock.</p>
<p>Bob shook his head. He must be dreaming.
His nerves must be over-wrought from too much
work and on edge from the talk he had earlier in
the evening with his uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Reaching out, he tilted the shade of his desk
lamp back and a flood of light struck the doorknob.
No! His eyes had not tricked him. The
knob was still turning. There was a faint click
and then the knob remained stationary.</p>
<p>Bob leaped into action. In one fast lunge he
was across the room, his hands gripping the doorknob.
He tugged hard, but the door refused to
open. Then he paused for hurried footsteps were
going down the hall. Bob shouted lustily. Perhaps
his cry would reach the guard at the elevators.</p>
<p>Then he shook the door. It couldn&rsquo;t be
locked, of that he felt sure. Bracing himself again
he tugged at the door and almost fell over backwards
when it suddenly opened.</p>
<p>Bob stepped into the corridor. There was no
one in sight but from a distance he could hear
someone hurrying toward him. A guard came
around a turn in the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you call just then?&rdquo; demanded the
watchman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I did,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;Someone was
trying the door here and when I tried to open it,
the door stuck. Then I let out a whoop. Didn&rsquo;t
you see anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one came my way,&rdquo; said the guard
quickly, but his eyes did not meet Bob&rsquo;s squarely.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better look along this end of the corridor.
If someone was here, he might have slipped into
one of the other offices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t have done that. Besides, I
distinctly remember hearing him running down
toward the elevators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wasn&rsquo;t asleep and no one came my
way,&rdquo; insisted the guard. &ldquo;Maybe you were
dreaming a little. You look kind of tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired, but this was no dream,&rdquo; insisted
Bob. Then he remembered the door. What had
made it stick? It hadn&rsquo;t been locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your flashlight,&rdquo; said Bob and the
guard handed over a shiny, metal tube.</p>
<p>Bob turned the beam of light on the floor, and
searched closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; asked the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the reason why the door stuck,&rdquo; said Bob
tartly. Then he found it&mdash;a thin sliver of steel
that had been inserted as a wedge. It was an innocent
enough looking piece, but when placed
properly in a door could cause considerable delay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Bob picked it up and placed it in his pocket.
Although he was not aware of it at the time, it
was the first piece of evidence in a mystery
which was to pull him deep into its folds and require
weeks of patient effort to untangle.</p>
<p>The guard had edged over to the door and
now reached out to pull it shut. Only a sharp
order from Bob stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your hands off the doorknob,&rdquo; he
ordered. &ldquo;Someone was tampering here and I
don&rsquo;t want you messing your hands around the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard hesitated as though undecided
whether to obey Bob, and the clerk stood up and
doubled up a fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not touch that door.&rdquo; There was a
steelly quietness in the words that decided the
guard, and he stepped well back into the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get back to your post. I&rsquo;ll take
care of this situation,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep your
flashlight and return it to you when I leave the
building. I want to do a little scouting around
and may need this light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>The guard grumbled something under his
breath, but retreated down the corridor and
finally vanished from sight. Bob disliked him
thoroughly for his attitude had been one of sullen
defiance; so unusual from the men generally
on duty at night. It might be well to speak to
Jacobs about it in the morning.</p>
<p>Just to make sure that no one came along and
touched the doorknob, Bob took out his handkerchief
and tied it around the knob in a manner
which would protect possible fingerprints.</p>
<p>That done, he picked up the flashlight again
and started to reconnoiter in the corridor, trying
one door after another. There was just a possibility
that the marauder had found a hiding place
in an office which had been left unlocked. Bob
knew that it was almost a useless quest, for the
offices were checked each night.</p>
<p>He made the rounds along one side of the corridor
and started back on the side opposite his
own office. The night lights were on and at the
far end of the corridor it was necessary for him
to use the flashlight.</p>
<p>Door after door proved unyielding to his
touch and he was about to give up the quest when
he came upon a door that swung inward when
his hands gripped the knob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Bob drew back suddenly and flashed the beam
of light into the long room, which was almost
identical with the one in which he had been
working. What he saw there startled him more
than he dared to admit later, and he stepped inside
and moved toward the nearest desk.</p>
<p>The ray from the flashlight revealed the utter
confusion in the room. Baskets of papers on top
of the desks had been upset and even the drawers
in the filing cabinets had been pulled out and
their contents hurled indiscriminately over the
floor.</p>
<p>A slight sound startled Bob and he swung
around, the beam of light focusing on the door.</p>
<p>It was closing&mdash;swiftly and silently.</p>
<p>Bob leaped forward, stumbled over a wastepaper
basket, and then reached the door which
clicked shut just before he could grasp the
handle.</p>
<p>Bob tugged hard on the door, but like the one
which led to his own office, it stuck.</p>
<p>Could it be another wedge of steel? Bob wondered
and braced himself for another lusty tug.
The door gave way and Bob toppled backward
in a heap, the flashlight falling and blinking out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Bob had fallen heavily and for a moment he
remained motionless on the floor listening for the
sound of someone moving along the corridor.
He could have shouted for the guard, but an inward
distrust of the man kept him from doing
that. Instead, he groped around for the flashlight,
turned it on, and got to his feet, considerably
shaken in mind and body by the experiences
of the last few minutes.</p>
<p>The young clerk reached for the light switch
and a glare of light flooded the room, revealing
even further the destruction which had been
wrought there.</p>
<p>Bob looked around. Hundreds of papers had
been strewn on the floor; some of them had been
ruthlessly destroyed and he wondered how many
valuable documents would be lost when they
finally checked up.</p>
<p>But this was no time for inaction, he decided,
and he hastened to one of the desks and picked
up a telephone. He dialed quickly, but it was
nearly a minute before a sleepy voice answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Uncle Merritt?&rdquo; asked Bob anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not home; I&rsquo;m still at the building. I
wish you&rsquo;d get down here as soon as you can.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t had an accident, but some
mighty strange things have been going on around
this floor tonight. One of the offices has been
completely ransacked. I&rsquo;m in it now. Papers
have been thrown all over and the filing cases
opened and a lot of stuff destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it? Gosh, I wish I knew. Someone&rsquo;s
been shutting doors on me and leaving steel
wedges in them. It&rsquo;s giving me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right down,&rdquo; promised the Department
of Justice agent.</p>
<p>Bob placed the receiver back on its hook and
backed out of the room. The fewer things he
touched the better it would be and as he drew
the door shut, he was careful to keep his hands
off the knob for there was a possibility of valuable
fingerprints being there.</p>
<p>An eerie feeling raced up and down Bob&rsquo;s
spine as he turned toward the door which opened
into the office where he worked. The building
was so quiet it was disturbing, yet he knew some
unknown marauder had been busy on the floor
while he had been bent over his desk. Could the
unknown be after the radio secrets his uncle had
hinted about? It was certainly worth considering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Bob reached the door that led into the office
where he worked and stopped suddenly. He
felt cold all over as he stared at the doorknob.
He remembered distinctly having wrapped his
own handkerchief around the knob to preserve
possible fingerprints. But there was no handkerchief
there now and the door was slightly ajar.
The light had been on when he stepped into the
hall, but now the room was in inky darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter VI</span></span>
<br />IN THE DARKENED ROOM<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob paused on the threshold of the long office,
staring into the blackness of the
room. After his recent experiences he
couldn&rsquo;t be blamed for hesitating a moment.</p>
<p>Should he close the door, back into the hall
and await his uncle&rsquo;s arrival or should he snap on
the lights and see what had taken place in the
room? It seemed to Bob that he pondered those
questions for several minutes; actually it was less
than five seconds.</p>
<p>He reached for the light switch at the left of
the doorway and pushed the button. But there
was no answering blaze of light; only the dead
click of the switch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Bob knew then that the lights had been tampered
with, that more than likely someone was
lurking in the shadowy darkness of the office.
His better judgment told him to wait until he
could summon assistance, but some other urge
drove him on. He couldn&rsquo;t explain it later; he
simply went ahead.</p>
<p>The young filing clerk stepped across the
threshold, the flashlight in his hand aimed down
the center of the room. Then he turned on the
flash and a beam of light cut through the darkness.</p>
<p>Bob gasped. The light showed papers strewn
over the floor and the drawers from desks and
filing cases pulled indiscriminately out and
dumped on the floor.</p>
<p>The shock of the confusion in the office
brought him up short. Then he started to swing
the light about the room to determine the full
extent of the damage by the marauder.</p>
<p>A slight noise to the right caught Bob&rsquo;s attention
and he turned in that direction. Instinctively
he knew that danger lurked there, and he tensed
his body. It came before he was ready; something
hurtling out of the dark; something that
struck his right hand a numbing blow; something
that sent the flashlight crashing to the floor where
the lens and the bulb shattered and the light went
out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>But the blow sent Bob into action. He must
get back to the door and get it closed; that would
cut off the one avenue of escape for the intruder.</p>
<p>The clerk leaped backward, his hands reaching
out for the doorway. He collided with someone
else; someone wearing a topcoat still damp from
the rain outside.</p>
<p>Bob thought quickly. He must find some way
to stop the other if for only an instant. He drew
back his right foot and swift kick connected with
the unknown&rsquo;s shins with such force that an involuntary
cry rang through the room. Bob
leaped on and crashed into the half opened door.
With anxious fingers he found the key on the inside,
slammed the door shut and turned the lock.</p>
<p>That done Bob dropped down on the floor
where he would have a chance to rest, to collect
his wits, and to plan his future course of action.</p>
<p>For a time there was no sound in the room. He
could not even catch the breathing of the other
man and he thought of the possibility that the
other had slipped out the door before he had
closed it. Then he dismissed that as an impossibility
for there had not been sufficient time for
that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Bob knew every inch of the long office; knew
where every desk and chair was located and
every window. As his eyes became more accustomed
to the dark he could pick out the lighter
blots which were the windows.</p>
<p>Then a slight noise caught his attention. The
unknown was moving, probably on his hands and
knees, feeling his way toward the door. Bob
couldn&rsquo;t resist a chuckle as he thought of the dismay
that would spread through the other when
he found the door securely locked and the key
missing.</p>
<p>Just to be on the safe side, Bob edged away
from the door and sought shelter behind a nearby
desk. To make sure that he would move
noiselessly he slipped off his shoes and placed
them beside a filing cabinet where he wouldn&rsquo;t
fall over them if it was necessary for him to make
a sudden move.</p>
<p>Strangely enough Bob felt very calm. His
heart beat rapidly and his breath came shorter
and faster, but his mind was remarkably clear, his
hands steady. He was glad now that he did not
have the flashlight, for using it would only have
made him a target for the marauder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Bob wondered how long it would take his
uncle to reach the scene. Probably another ten
minutes, for Merritt Hughes lived a considerable
distance from the building. What might happen
inside that room in the next ten minutes was
something that Bob didn&rsquo;t care to guess about.</p>
<p>As Bob listened he could hear the almost noiseless
movements of the other man and knew that
he was nearing the door. Then he heard hands
moving along the woodwork&mdash;finally the gentle
turning of the doorknob. Then there was the
sharp rattle of the knob as though a sudden wave
of anger had swept over the man at the realization
that he had been trapped in the room.</p>
<p>Bob moved away from the door, crawling on
his hands and knees, and he kept going until he
was well down the room and right at the steel
cabinet where the radio documents were filed.
With cautious hands he felt along the front of the
case. So far the drawers had not been pulled out
for they were identified only by key numbers
instead of by the name of the type of papers
which they contained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>This was one cabinet Bob was determined to
protect, for, after what his uncle had told him
earlier in the night, he felt sure that this was the
object of the unknown&rsquo;s visit.</p>
<p>Once more the doorknob was rattled sharply;
then silence again shrouded the room and Bob
felt his nerves tightening. It was tough waiting
alone in the darkness. He wondered if the other
man possessed a gun and if he would have the
nerve to use it if an emergency caught him.</p>
<p>Bob strained his ears for some sound of the
other&rsquo;s maneuvers. A faint sort of &ldquo;plop&rdquo; made
him smile. It sounded very much like a shoe
being placed gently on the floor. Several seconds
later there was a similar sound and Bob knew that
they were now on even terms; neither one of
them having his shoes on. This man was no fool;
he was determined to keep his own movements
as secret as possible.</p>
<p>Then Bob heard a sound which was anything
but heartening. The unknown was coming
toward him. He could hear the gentle scrape
of knees as the man crawled along the floor. He
was evidently feeling his way along the filing
cabinets and Bob moved out toward the center
of the room where he found protection between
two desks, set fairly close together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>His action was not a minute too soon, for he
had barely settled himself in his new position
when he saw a darker shadow moving along in
front of the filing cases. The man was less than
six feet away, and breathing very quietly, but
steadily.</p>
<p>Bob held his own breath as the man passed
along the row of filing cases. Evidently he was
going to make the rounds of the room in an effort
to catch Bob by surprise, overpower him, and
take away the key. Bob chuckled inwardly at
that thought. He was too familiar with the room
to be caught in that manner.</p>
<p>Moving out slightly from behind the shelter of
the desks, he saw the man reach a window and
raise his head so that he could look down on the
street. It was a temptation that Bob couldn&rsquo;t resist
and he picked up an inkwell on the desk beside
him, took careful aim, and hurled the heavy
glass container.</p>
<p>Just as he threw the inkwell, Bob slipped and
the noise attracted the attention of the other man.
He leaped to his feet and whirled about. The
glass container, instead of striking the man&rsquo;s head,
hit his shoulder, glanced into the window and
crashed its way on out into the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>There was a cry of pain from the intruder and
then a sharp burst of flame as a bullet scarred the
top of the desk which shielded Bob.</p>
<p>Bob went cold all over. There was no more
fun in this thing. It was deadly serious now and
he knew that his very life might depend on the
events of the coming minutes for this man was
cornered and capable of shooting his way out if
necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter VII</span></span>
<br />SIRENS IN THE NIGHT<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>As the echoes of the shot died in the room,
Bob realized that he had been foolish in
throwing the inkwell. It had unduly
alarmed the other man and placed his own life in
jeopardy. The slug from the gun had come much
closer than Bob wanted it to.</p>
<p>There was only one consolation. The shot
should attract the attention of the guards on duty
in the building and within a minute they should
be at the door, battering their way in. Against
superior numbers Bob felt that the intruder
would not put up a resistance with gun play.</p>
<p>Bob stared at the windows. The head and
shoulders of the unknown had disappeared and
the distant noises of the street were clearer now,
drifting in through the broken window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Merritt Hughes should arrive at almost any
minute and Bob felt that the wise and sensible
thing now was to play as safe as possible and await
the arrival of help.</p>
<p>Crouched down between the desks, he was in
a position to watch the file with the radio documents
and he knew that if they were molested he
would fight with all his strength to protect them.</p>
<p>As the seconds passed into minutes Bob felt
his muscles tensing and his nerves becoming
tighter.</p>
<p>There was no sound in the room; there had
been no sound since the echoes of the shot had
died away. Had his missile disabled the other
man; had the shot been fired involuntarily?
They were questions he couldn&rsquo;t answer.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t a night guard appear in the corridor
outside? Bob believed that he would have
risked a call for help if anyone passed. But strain
as he might, he could hear no one outside the
door.</p>
<p>Then Bob broke into a cold sweat. The man
who had fired the shot was almost beside him.</p>
<p>Bob had been so intent upon listening for some
sound in the corridor that he had failed to hear
the unknown crawling toward his own hiding
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Bob sensed, rather than saw, what was happening.
He could hear the steady breathing of
the other and he held his own breath. Would
the man crawl on down the room toward the
doorway or would he turn in between the desks
where Bob had sought shelter?</p>
<p>The dark blob that was the other&rsquo;s head and
shoulders appeared between the desks and Bob
waited for an agonizing interval. Then the figure
moved on and Bob could breathe once more.</p>
<p>That had been a close call.</p>
<p>Then came another sound that brought Bob
back to the alert. There was the faint shrilling of
a siren.</p>
<p>Was it a fire alarm? Bob listened intently.
No, it was sharper, more penetrating. A police
car. That was it!</p>
<p>It was evident that the other man had also
heard the night alarm for Bob heard a muffled
exclamation. He doubted if it was an alarm
turned in by his uncle for his protection, but at
least it was enough to alarm the marauder and
Bob&rsquo;s muscles snapped back to steelly tension.
He had gone so far now that he had no intention
of allowing the other to escape at the last minute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The steady wail of the siren drew nearer as
down on the avenue the speeding machine dashed
through traffic lights and skidded past other
machines which were pulling over to give it the
right of way.</p>
<p>The siren rose to a crescendo and then died to
a wail as the police car swayed to a stop somewhere
below and Bob knew then that rescue was
near. His uncle, feeling the need for quick re-enforcements,
had evidently called on the Washington
police and commandeered a cruising radio
car.</p>
<p>From somewhere out of the darkness came a
low, deadly voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, kid, this spot is getting tough. Give
me the key to this door or I&rsquo;m going to turn this
gun loose and it will be just too bad if I get you.
I&rsquo;ve got plenty of extra clips and I&rsquo;m going out of
here on my feet. Give me that key!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob knew there was no time to lose for there
was a ring of panic in the other&rsquo;s voice and you
never could tell what a panic-stricken man
would do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The desks afforded little protection from a
barrage of bullets and Bob quickly edged his way
out from behind them and in between two steel
filing cases. While these were not intended to
be bullet proof, at least they were much better
than oak desks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me?&rdquo; called the voice from near
the doorway. &ldquo;Give me that key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob slipped his hands into his pockets, and
pulled out a key ring. The key to his own room
was somewhat similar to the one that fitted the
door of this office. He quickly detached this and
tossed it toward the door.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t afford to cry out now for he knew
the man near the door would shoot. The key
fell on the floor and he could hear the frantic
efforts of the other to locate it. Then came a
gasp of relief from the unknown and Bob heard
him fumbling at the keyhole, trying to insert the
key and turn it in the lock.</p>
<p>There was a sharp cry from the man at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve tricked me. Give me the right key.
Give it to me!&rdquo; The voice was nearing a hysterical
pitch and Bob smiled grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>The man couldn&rsquo;t stand the dark and the certain
knowledge that outside men were speeding
toward that very room, men who would shoot
first and ask questions afterward.</p>
<p>Bob wondered whether tossing another key
would again trick the man at the door.</p>
<p>Before he could decide there was a stab of
flame in the blackness and a bullet crashed
through the desks where he had been hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on; give me that key!&rdquo; The voice was
hysterical now, a scream that cut through the
room and echoed out the shattered window.</p>
<p>Down below another police siren was ebbing
as a second car pulled up at the curb and disgorged
its load of armed men, who rushed into
the building to follow the lead of the first detail.</p>
<p>Bob faintly heard elevator doors clang open. It
would be only seconds now until they were at
the door, beating their way in.</p>
<p>By this time Bob&rsquo;s eyes were well accustomed
to the darkness and he could distinguish the
shadow of the man crouched near the door,
listening now to the pounding of the police as
they charged up the long corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, Bob! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>It was Merritt Hughes and Bob thrilled at the
voice of his uncle. Then dismay filled him for he
knew what would happen if they broke down
the door and charged into the room for a trapped
man is always dangerous.</p>
<p>Fists beat against the door and two ribbons of
flame streaked from the gun, the bullets crashing
through the door and out into the corridor.</p>
<p>Bob couldn&rsquo;t help shouting a warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away; he&rsquo;s desperate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to that was another shot into the
desks where he had been hiding and Bob knew
that the man felt sure he was still hiding there.</p>
<p>There was a sudden silence in the corridor and
Bob knew that his uncle and the police were conferring
on the best way to break into the room.
As he listened he saw the man near the door moving,
backing down into the room where Bob was
hiding and if he kept on coming he would pass
within a foot or less of Bob.</p>
<p>Bob felt his muscles tightening and he breathed
deeply. If he could only disable the unknown, it
would solve what promised to become a highly
dangerous situation.</p>
<p>The man was coming noiselessly, in his stocking
feet, his head cocked toward the door where
he listened for some further move.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>A yard, two feet and now only inches separated
them. Bob was ready. His hands shot out
and caught the other man in a steelly grasp that
choked an involuntary cry from him. At the
same time Bob kicked with all of his strength.
The blow caught the other man behind the knees
and Bob could feel him crumpling.</p>
<p>The gun, which he had feared the most, clattered
to the floor and they were on equal terms,
ready now to fight hand to hand.</p>
<p>As they fell the other man twisted about and
Bob knew that his adversary was no weakling.
He could feel the muscles of the other man&rsquo;s arms
tightening and a short, sickening blow that
started at the floor caught him on the chin.</p>
<p>Bob was weak all over for a moment, an interval
just long enough to give the other a chance
to collect his wits. Then Bob was at him again,
his arms held in close, his fists raining blows like
a trip hammer. They were hard, fierce jabs that
would have rocked an ordinary man to sleep in
less than ten seconds. He heard the other gasp as
a right caught him in the midriff, but he came
back for more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Fighting in the dark was dangerous business.
A wild blow might send his hand crashing into a
steel case or against a desk and his knuckles might
be broken but it was a chance Bob had to take
and he slammed away with a will.</p>
<p>Suddenly the man went limp. Bob caught
him, fearing a ruse, and shot home one more hard
right. Then he knew that the other was out&mdash;out
cold, and he suddenly went weak himself.</p>
<p>Fists were beating against the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open up, open up!&rdquo; It was Merritt Hughes&rsquo;
voice.</p>
<p>Bob managed a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all right?&rdquo; demanded the federal agent,
but Bob was too weak and tired to reply.</p>
<p>Somehow he managed to dig the key out of
his pocket and with trembling fingers he found
the keyhole, inserted the key and turned the lock.
The door burst open to reveal Bob standing on
wavering legs, and Merritt Hughes caught him
just as he collapsed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter VIII</span></span>
<br />THE PAPER VANISHES<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Lights from a whole battery of flashlights
seemed to blaze down at Bob and he
blinked hard as Merritt Hughes leaned
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, Bob, are you hurt?&rdquo; demanded the ace
federal agent.</p>
<p>Bob managed to shake his head. Just then he
was too exhausted even to talk.</p>
<p>As he watched the flashlights swept around the
room, revealing its wild disorder. Then the lights
focused on the form of a man sprawled out under
the nearest desk and Bob caught his breath for the
man was in a uniform of one of the night watchmen.
So that was the reason why there had been
no response to his calls for help; the marauder had
been the guard!</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes stepped over to the unconscious
form and gazed at the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly landed a haymaker on one
eye,&rdquo; he told Bob. &ldquo;Know who he is?&rdquo; Bob
managed to sit up where he could glimpse the
other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the guard who was on duty tonight,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know his name. He is a new
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes chuckled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s going to a lot different place.
Maybe he&rsquo;ll be able to remember his name and
tell us a few things when he wakes up. Now just
what happened here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; began Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then save it until we&rsquo;re alone later. Was
anyone else running around up here tonight except
yourself and the guard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob thought instantly of Tully Ross, then decided
to wait and tell his uncle about that when
they were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fellow was the only intruder,&rdquo; replied
Bob, which was true enough, for Tully belonged
to the office staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him down to the nearest station and
have him fingerprinted and photographed,&rdquo; the
federal agent told the policemen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>The officers leaned down and picked up the
man Bob had fought and managed somehow to
get him to his feet. Supporting him on their
shoulders they walked him down the hall and
Bob heard the elevator doors click.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s uncle tried to turn on the lights in the
room, but the switches, though they snapped as
usual, failed to send any current into the lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuses blown,&rdquo; Bob heard him mutter.</p>
<p>They were alone now, the police having departed
with their prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an extra flashlight, Bob. See if you
can find anything missing by making a hurried
search around the room,&rdquo; directed Merritt
Hughes.</p>
<p>Bob felt stronger now and he got to his feet.
He was still a little unsteady, but the cool, rain
washed air, coming in sharp gusts through the
window now, cleared his head and he took the
flashlight which his uncle offered.</p>
<p>The twin beams of light swept around the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a mess!&rdquo; exclaimed the federal agent,
as the lights revealed the utter confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Arthur Jacobs is the filing chief for this
room,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better get him on the telephone
and see that he gets down here at once. Explain
what&rsquo;s happened and tell him that you want to
check over the files for any possible missing
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob looked up the number of the filing chief&rsquo;s
home telephone and dialed. It was some time before
a sleepy voice answered and when Bob informed
the filing chief who was speaking the
voice was sharp and angry.</p>
<p>But when he imparted the news and added that
a federal agent was waiting for his arrival and the
checkup, the filing chief promised to come down
at once.</p>
<p>In the meantime a janitor came up from somewhere
below and fixed the fuses so that there was
ample light in the long room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can start in checking up on the files now,&rdquo;
said Bob, but his uncle held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a thing touched until the filing
chief is here,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Then, if something
important is missing, you&rsquo;ll have a clean bill of
health.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure that nothing important has come
through lately,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t
know definitely when important records are
being filed, but we usually have a pretty good
hunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s hoping that your hunch has been
right,&rdquo; replied his uncle.</p>
<p>Bob told him about the condition of the other
room down the hall and they went there and examined
it at some length, finally deciding to lock
and seal the door until morning when a more
thorough inspection could be made.</p>
<p>By the time they were back in the room where
Bob worked, the elevator doors clanged open
and they could hear impatient footsteps hurrying
toward them.</p>
<p>Arthur Jacobs, short, heavy and round-faced,
fairly popped through the door. His blue eyes
went wide as he saw the litter of papers in the
room and Bob felt sorry for the filing chief for
Jacobs had a splendid record of efficiency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What under the sun happened?&rdquo; demanded
Jacobs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was so sleepy I was sharp
with you over the phone,&rdquo; he told Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I would have been a little provoked at
being routed out at this time of night,&rdquo; admitted
Bob. &ldquo;I guess my uncle can tell you better than
I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Jacobs, after glancing again at the wild
confusion of papers on the floor, faced the federal
agent.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes described the events of the
night briefly and Bob saw the filing chief casting
anxious glances toward one of the steel cabinets.
His own heart missed a beat or two for the cabinet
that appeared to be worrying the filing chief
was the one in which the newest radio documents
were kept. It was here that any papers relating
to new discoveries in this field would be placed.</p>
<p>But Bob managed to reassure himself. He was
convinced that only the man he had caught could
have been in the room and there had been no way
for him to get rid of any papers which he might
have stolen from the file.</p>
<p>Then Arthur Jacobs interrupted the federal
agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute. Some important papers came
through late this afternoon and I placed them in
one of the files myself. I want to be sure that
they&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>The filing chief stepped to the radio filing
cabinet and skimmed through the papers with
expert fingers.</p>
<p>Bob saw the frown of anxiety deepen on the
filing chief&rsquo;s face as his fingers sorted the documents
expertly. Jacobs shook his head and then
bent down and scanned each document on the
floor in front of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything important missing?&rdquo; asked Merritt
Hughes.</p>
<p>Jacobs didn&rsquo;t answer at once, and when he
finally looked up, Bob read the answer in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the filing chief in a voice so low
that it carried only a few feet, &ldquo;the papers which
came over this afternoon have vanished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter IX</span></span>
<br />SUSPICIONS<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob and his uncle stared at Arthur Jacobs
with unbelieving eyes, and the filing chief
saw their doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The papers are gone&mdash;gone I tell you.&rdquo; His
voice rose almost to a frenzy for this was the first
time that such a thing had occurred in his usually
well ordered and carefully routined department,
and he had visions of losing his job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, we heard you,&rdquo; replied Merritt
Hughes. &ldquo;But perhaps you missed them in going
through the file. Let&rsquo;s go through together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; said Jacobs in a flat
and hopeless voice. &ldquo;I know this file from A to Z
and the papers that came in this afternoon are not
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal agent paused and looked hard at
the filing chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say they were important papers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Jacobs nodded. &ldquo;They were so important
that I refused to trust them to anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure no one in the department knew
these papers were coming through?&rdquo; insisted the
federal agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; replied the filing chief, &ldquo;for
there has been talk drifting around the last few
days about some important radio discoveries that
have been made by the army engineers. But I
am sure that no one knew the exact time these
papers came over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a complete file on the new discoveries?&rdquo;
asked Merritt Hughes anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but from the usual procedure, I
would say that it was only a partial file. Just as a
precautionary step they usually send the records
of new formulas, and developments over in several
sections so that it would be almost impossible
to take one section and know what it was all
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not sure about this special file?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, except that it was small; a single sheet of
paper in a sturdy manila envelope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go through everything in the
room,&rdquo; decided Bob&rsquo;s uncle, and they got down
on their hands and knees and started rummaging
through the litter of papers.</p>
<p>It would take days to place these back in their
proper sequences and Bob felt sorry for Jacobs.</p>
<p>They finished one side of the room and started
down another. There was no sign of the missing
envelope and Bob&rsquo;s uncle phoned the precinct
police station to learn if such an envelope had
been found on the prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search him again,&rdquo; he instructed the police
when they informed him that no envelope or
papers of any description had been found.</p>
<p>Bob looked toward the half opened window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it would have been possible for
him to toss that paper out the window and have
it picked up by someone on the ground?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes went to the window and
looked down. It was better than a hundred feet
to the ground and the sharpness of the wind had
not lessened. He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that happened,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
would have been too risky. Either that paper is
still in this room or it was taken out by that fellow
when he left.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the police haven&rsquo;t found anything,&rdquo; protested
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes even the police slip up when they
run into an especially clever crook and this man
had to be clever to get in here in a guard&rsquo;s uniform
and stand night duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their search of the room neared an end and
Arthur Jacobs looked even more downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it was missing when I failed to find it
in the file,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;This is where I lose my
reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that. We&rsquo;ve got to find
this paper first,&rdquo; said Merritt Hughes. &ldquo;Go
through the file once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the federal agent on one side and Bob on
the other, the filing chief examined every paper
in the cabinet, but without success.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes turned on his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure that you were the only one in
this office until this fellow got in?&rdquo; he asked Bob.</p>
<p>Bob hesitated, wondering whether he dared
implicate Tully Ross by mentioning his name.
But Tully had been there and the disappearance
of the radio document was too important to let
anything like that interfere, he decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tully Ross dropped in for a few minutes,&rdquo;
said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this in the first
place?&rdquo; asked the federal agent, and Bob felt the
color in his cheeks mounting at the rebuke which
was implied by his uncle&rsquo;s words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter X</span></span>
<br />ON THE LEDGE<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Arthur Jacobs wheeled around sharply, at
the exchange between uncle and
nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Ross doing here at night?&rdquo; demanded
the filing chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he just dropped in; saw the lights
burning up here and wondered what was going
on,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he touch anything, work on anything?&rdquo;
There was a desperate note of anxiety in the filing
chief&rsquo;s voice and Bob knew that Jacobs was
thinking only of the reputation of his department
rather than linking Tully to the events of
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he only offered to help me, but I told
him I was getting along all right,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ask you about any of the papers you
were filing?&rdquo; pressed the federal agent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly, but he did mention something
about the radio secrets. That&rsquo;s been more
or less common knowledge in the department
that something big was breaking and we have
all been curious about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Tully touch this file or go into it?&rdquo; demanded
the filing chief.</p>
<p>Bob hesitated. Tully had looked into the file,
but he hadn&rsquo;t removed anything Bob was sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did he touch anything?&rdquo; pressed
Jacobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did open this file,&rdquo; admitted Bob, &ldquo;but I
looked up just then and I am sure that he didn&rsquo;t
remove anything. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think he
touched anything inside the file.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he open the file?&rdquo; asked Merritt
Hughes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he mentioned something about wanting
to see the way I kept my files. I guess he said
he had heard Mr. Jacobs say he liked the way I
handled them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacobs smiled for it was no secret with him
that Bob was his star assistant, while Tully was
probably the poorest of the clerks who worked
in the filing room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure Tully didn&rsquo;t take anything out?&rdquo;
insisted his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be positive,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
believe anything was removed by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes was silent for a minute.
When he spoke again he addressed his words to
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Tully on the telephone and tell him to
dress and get down here right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the tone of his voice, Bob knew that it
would be useless to say anything more in defense
of the other clerk and he went to the telephone
and dialed Tully&rsquo;s apartment number. It was
two o&rsquo;clock now and an unearthly hour to rout
anyone out of bed, so Bob prepared himself for
a long wait at the telephone. He was not disappointed
for it was at least three minutes before
a sleepy voice answered and Bob recognized it
as that of Tully.</p>
<p>When he explained that the other clerk must
come down at once, there were sleepy protests
and Bob&rsquo;s uncle, provoked at Tully&rsquo;s attitude,
took the phone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tully, this is Merritt Hughes. There&rsquo;s been
trouble in this office tonight. You are one of
two outsiders who were in here. If you know
what&rsquo;s good for you, get down here at once and
don&rsquo;t argue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he hung up the receiver without
giving Tully an opportunity to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll be down without losing any
time,&rdquo; he said, and Bob was ready to agree.</p>
<p>Tully lived some distance from the office.
Bob knew that it would be nearly half an hour
before he could arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a flashlight,&rdquo; he said to his uncle,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go down on the ground floor and see if
there is any chance that paper was thrown from
the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes nodded his agreement and
handed a light to Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along,&rdquo; said Arthur Jacobs. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
stay up here and do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The filing chief was visibly shaken and Bob
was glad enough to have companionship for
there would be no fun in prowling through the
shrubbery at the base of the building at that hour
of the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>They walked down the corridor together and
turned and faced the elevator entrance. The cage
came up in answer to their summons and they
dropped swiftly toward the first floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find out yet what happened to the regular
guard on our floor?&rdquo; Bob asked the elevator
operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve checked his home, but he left there
right on time. It&rsquo;s a cinch he never reached here,
though. This building has been searched from
top to bottom and there&rsquo;s no sign of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they stepped out on the main floor
there was evidence of suppressed activity for
several guards, flashlights in their hands, hurried
past them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re even searching the closets,&rdquo; volunteered
the elevator operator, &ldquo;for the fellow
who was caught up on your floor was wearing
the guard&rsquo;s uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob whistled softly. This was getting more
serious every minute. He wondered about phoning
the news upstairs to his uncle. But he decided
against that. They would soon return to the upper
floor and he could tell him then.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The night was as blustery as ever and Bob
drew his topcoat close as the first gust of wind
and rain swept down on them. The flashlights
threw feeble glows ahead of them as they floundered
through the shrubbery which flanked the
base of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; cried the filing chief as a piece of
shrubbery snapped into his face and Bob turned
to help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on; I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Jacobs and they
pushed ahead, Bob in the lead.</p>
<p>Back and forth they beat their way through
the shrubbery, their lights held close to the
ground. Time after time they stopped to pick up
a sheet of paper in the faint hope that it might
be the missing radio document they were seeking
so anxiously.</p>
<p>Now they were directly under the windows of
the office. Bob, looking up, could see the glow of
lights from the windows. Here they were
doubly careful to make a thorough search and
Arthur Jacobs went over every inch of the
ground with his own light, stooping to be sure
that no scrap of paper went unobserved.</p>
<p>The quest looked hopeless and Bob stood up
to ease his aching back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we might as well give up,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Tully will be here in a few minutes and we&rsquo;ll
want to be back upstairs when he arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just a chance the paper might have
been blown around the corner,&rdquo; said the filing
chief, who was determined to cling to even the
most slender hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a chance, but it&rsquo;s a mighty slim
one. We&rsquo;ll have a try, though,&rdquo; agreed Bob.</p>
<p>The rain was even sharper as they turned to the
corner of the building and the lights attempted
to pierce the blackness of the hour.</p>
<p>For five minutes they crawled back and forth
underneath the shrubbery. Bob was chilled now
and a trickle of water, coming off his hat and
dropping down his neck, did nothing to improve
his spirits. His knees and back ached and it would
seem good to get back into the office where it
was light and warm and there would be no rain
to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve looked under every shrub on
this side of the building,&rdquo; finally said Arthur
Jacobs and there was a bitter note of disappointment
in his voice. &ldquo;We might as well give up and
go back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Bob straightened up and the beam from his
flashlight struck one of the deep, recessed windows
that were on the ground floor. The ledge
in front of the window itself was at least two feet
wide and it was on this ledge that the beam of
light centered.</p>
<p>Bob cried out involuntarily and Arthur Jacobs,
hearing the cry, whirled to his side.</p>
<p>Something was on that ledge; something that
was shrouded in black. Bob&rsquo;s heart leaped with
an emotion that was one of combined fear and
curiosity and with Jacobs at his side he plunged
forward through the shrubbery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XI</span></span>
<br />STRAINED TEMPERS<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob was the first to reach the ledge, which
was about two feet above the ground level
and well protected from the onslaughts of
the storm.</p>
<p>His flashlight revealed the figure of a man,
swathed in a dark blanket, jammed up against the
window.</p>
<p>Bob was reaching for the blanket when Arthur
Jacobs seized his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;d better wait until we can get
your uncle down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; decided Bob, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find out what this
is all about right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he pulled the blanket off the figure
and stared down into the pain-wracked eyes of
the guard who was usually on duty on his floor.
A gag, which had been ruthlessly put in place,
made speech for the captive out of the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Run for help!&rdquo; Bob told Arthur Jacobs and
the filing chief departed as rapidly as his short legs
would carry him.</p>
<p>While he was waiting for help, Bob busied
himself in an effort to unfasten the captive&rsquo;s
bonds.</p>
<p>Picture wire had been used to bind the man&rsquo;s
hands and wrists and the gag was of rough, heavy
material which was held in place by strips of adhesive
tape. It was to this that Bob gave his first
attention for from the expression in the guard&rsquo;s
eyes he knew that the gag was causing him untold
agony.</p>
<p>With capable but gentle fingers, Bob worked
at the gag until the cruel bandage was freed. He
bent down close to hear the first whisper from the
man&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob half propped the captive up and then
turned in quest of some water. Anything halfway
decent would do. Nearby a small torrent
was coming from one of the drain spouts. It had
been raining for hours, so the spouting should
have been clean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>The filing clerk cupped his hands under the
spout and got a double handful of water. This
he carried back to the ledge and let it trickle into
the other&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>He was just finishing his task when Arthur
Jacobs, followed by half a dozen guards, appeared
on the run, the beams from their flashlights
cutting a broad swath of light through the
darkness.</p>
<p>The guards picked up the captive and carried
him inside. Blankets were produced, the wire
was cut from his hands and feet. By this time
Merritt Hughes, who had been notified, was
down on the ground floor. He took charge immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get this man to a hospital at once,&rdquo; he
directed. &ldquo;Two of you go along to see that he
talks with no one. Understand, no one. I&rsquo;ll be
around soon and talk with him as soon as they get
him into bed and take every precaution to avoid
pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob felt sorry for the guard. He had been
stripped of his uniform, bound and gagged and
had been helpless on the ledge for hours. It
would be a miracle if he did not suffer an attack
of pneumonia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>An ambulance, which had been summoned, arrived,
and they saw the guard lifted into the
vehicle. Two other guards climbed in beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, no one is to talk with him until I
arrive,&rdquo; Merritt Hughes ordered.</p>
<p>As they turned to re-enter the building, the
federal agent spoke to Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tully Ross got here just before the guard was
found. Come along upstairs while I question
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were waiting for the elevator when a
short, thick-set man hastened in. He was scowling
and obviously had been routed out of bed.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes turned to greet the newcomer
and as he recognized him there was no cordiality
in the greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Adams,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to
see you here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped the other, &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t think for a minute you can bull-doze my
nephew and get away with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know darned well what I mean. Didn&rsquo;t
you just phone Tully Ross and order him down
here; didn&rsquo;t you practically threaten him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call it exactly a threat, but I did
tell him to get down here at once if he knew what
was good for him. No clerk is going to be impudent
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes spoke firmly and calmly, but
there was something in the flash of his eyes that
told Condon Adams that he had gone far enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to come along while I talk with
Tully, you&rsquo;re quite welcome,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Condon Adams grunted and shouldered his
way ahead of them and into the elevator.</p>
<p>They were silent as they rode up to the top
floor and strode down the corridor to the office
where Tully Ross was waiting for them.</p>
<p>Tully&rsquo;s dark, rather handsome face, was
marked by frowns as he saw Bob enter behind
Merritt Hughes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s been going on here?&rdquo; demanded
Condon Adams as he surveyed the room with
cool, calculating eyes. Suddenly he saw the radio
file and he swung to face Merritt Hughes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case getting hot?&rdquo; He shot the question
out in short, chopped-off words.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s uncle nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine one you are not to let me know,&rdquo; said
Adams bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall that you&rsquo;ve ever tipped me off
to any breaks in any case we&rsquo;ve worked on before,&rdquo;
said Merritt Hughes coolly. &ldquo;When you
get in that habit I&rsquo;ll try to learn your telephone
number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Condon Adams snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what I expected. Well, let&rsquo;s get along
here. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn all that in good time,&rdquo; said Bob&rsquo;s
uncle. &ldquo;Right now I&rsquo;m in charge and I want to
know why Tully came up to the office tonight
and why he tried to look through the radio file.
Speak up, Tully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell,&rdquo; began Tully. &ldquo;I
was going by and when I saw the lights on in the
office I came up. Just curiosity, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it wasn&rsquo;t anything more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you try to look into the radio
file?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Tully shot a bitter glance at Bob for he realized
that Bob was the only source of information
on his activities while he was in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was curiosity, too. You know there&rsquo;s
been talk around about some important papers
coming over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Jacobs wrung his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk, talk, talk. Are there no secrets any
more in this department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; retorted Tully, who appeared to
take malicious glee in taunting the filing chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Tully. You know there have
been serious happenings. Bob was attacked by a
marauder who had gone through the files here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he doing out of the room; how did
anyone get in?&rdquo; It was Condon Adams&rsquo; turn to
speak.</p>
<p>Bob replied sharply, explaining what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call it mighty poor judgment on your part
to leave this room no matter what the circumstances,&rdquo;
said Adams. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll lodge a complaint
against you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s going far enough,&rdquo; Merritt Hughes
said firmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind. If
this thing is going to get as personal as that I&rsquo;ll
file one against your nephew for coming up here
and attempting to get into a file that is prohibited
to him. Now how would you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was obvious that Adams did not relish the
suggestion and the whole matter of filing complaints
was dropped right there.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes took charge then, questioning
Tully carefully about all of his actions while he
was in the room. Tully was surly, but he answered
truthfully enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Bob?&rdquo; asked the federal agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Doubt my word?&rdquo; flared
Tully, his dark face flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply checking,&rdquo; said Bob&rsquo;s uncle and the
tone of his voice invited no further remarks from
Tully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tully&rsquo;s told exactly what happened up until
the time he left the room,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then suppose you tell us what happened
after he left and you were left here alone,&rdquo; interjected
Condon Adams. There was an unpleasant
inflection in his voice that Bob resented; an implication
that Bob might have been responsible
for whatever had taken place that night. Merritt
Hughes got it, too, but he ignored it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Bob told his story in a straight-forward manner.
Once or twice Adams interrupted to ask
questions, but he gained little satisfaction from
his efforts to heckle Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well we&rsquo;ve got two more sources of information,&rdquo;
said Merritt Hughes. &ldquo;One is the man who
was captured in this room and the other is the
guard who was found on the ledge down below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one are you going to question first?&rdquo;
asked Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s late now. I think I&rsquo;ll see
them in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not trying to give me the slip, are you?&rdquo; the
words shot out of Adams&rsquo; mouth, which was
twisted into a bitter sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply handling this case in my own
way,&rdquo; replied Merritt Hughes evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s your case or
not. Remember that both of us have been assigned
to this radio angle. Well, you do the work
and I&rsquo;ll get the information out of your reports.
It will save me a lot of tedious detail. Come on,
Tully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Condon Adams, moving as rapidly as his
short, thick legs would carry him, left the room
and Tully, with a backward glance of mingled
relief and unsatisfied curiosity, trailed after him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>Merritt Hughes, watching them depart, shook
his head and Bob heard his uncle mutter, &ldquo;What
a precious pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going home and get some sleep.
You&rsquo;ve been through enough for one night.
Jacobs, see that he is relieved of routine tomorrow.
I want him with me when I question
these men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the necessary arrangements,&rdquo; promised
the filing chief, who was still looking disconsolately
at the mess of papers scattered over
the floor. &ldquo;Use Bob as long as you need him and
I&rsquo;ll fix up the reports here. Good luck and good
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; replied the federal agent and
Bob echoed the words. They strode down the
hall together, entered the elevator, and when
they reached the entrance of the building were
fortunate enough to hail an owl cab which went
cruising by.</p>
<p>The air was fresh, but the rain, coming down
steadily, was driven by a sharp wind and the
night was as raw as ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XII</span></span>
<br />STEPS IN THE HALL<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob leaned back in the taxi. It was restful
listening to the steady hum of the tires on
the wet pavement. His uncle looked at
him quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much all in?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Bob nodded. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m willing to admit that
I&rsquo;m more than a little tired and my muscles ache
a good bit from that tussle in the dark back in the
office. I thought for a minute that fellow was
going to get away from me. It&rsquo;s a good thing you
put in an appearance when you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew speed was essential and I corralled a
few of the local police to help me out,&rdquo; chuckled
Merritt Hughes. &ldquo;Still think you&rsquo;d like to be a
real federal agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how!&rdquo; said Bob sincerely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got the
thrilling kind of a life I&rsquo;d like to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of thinking it is all
thrills and fun. There are months upon months
when the cases are the merest of routines and the
work is real drudgery. But every so often something
bobs up that does add a zest to living.
Where do you suppose that radio document
went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew. Jacobs will worry himself sick
until it is recovered. I knew something was in
the air, but none of us thought anything important
had been sent over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, someone knew it and that someone
must have had inside knowledge. There was no
guess work in rifling those files.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but someone got into the wrong office
the first time,&rdquo; said Bob, recalling the ransacking
of the other office on the same corridor. He felt
in his pocket for the thin steel wedges which had
been used in the doors. Snapping on the dome
light in the taxi, he held them in the palm of his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These wedges were used in an attempt to
lock the doors and keep me in,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I
forgot all about them until just now. What do
you make of them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>His uncle looked at them sharply, but refused
to touch them. Pulling out a clean handkerchief,
he had Bob drop the wedges into the cloth, covered
them carefully and placed them in an inside
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn them over to the laboratory. They
may be able to find some fingerprints if they
haven&rsquo;t been handled by too many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one who&rsquo;s handled them outside
of the man who put them in place,&rdquo; declared Bob,
who felt that here might be a really important
clue.</p>
<p>The taxi swung toward the curb. A dull light
gleamed over the entrance of the apartment
house where Bob had a room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo; his uncle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. I&rsquo;ll take a shower and hop into
bed. Don&rsquo;t forget to stop for me when you go
down town to interview those fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a promise,&rdquo; agreed the federal agent.</p>
<p>Bob jumped out of the cab, hurried across the
parking and into the entrance of the apartment.
Turning, he watched the cab pull away from the
curb. Then he inserted his key in the lock and
entered the building. The air was warm and
dank and it made him sleepy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>His room was on the third floor at the back and
the lights in the hallway were none too bright.
Bob&rsquo;s room was part of an apartment occupied
by an elderly couple, but it had an outside entrance
on the hallway and he could come and go
as he pleased.</p>
<p>Another feature of it was a private bathroom.
In spite of its comparative luxury, he was able to
obtain the room for a rent well within his modest
means for Bob also acted as a sort of caretaker
for the apartment when the older people were
away on one of their extensive trips.</p>
<p>Bob unlocked the door of his room. He had
left one window partially open and the air here
was fresh. Turning on the lights he undressed
quickly and stepped into the bathroom where he
was soon under a shower.</p>
<p>A rough toweling down made his body glow
and then he pulled on fresh pajamas. The clock
on the dresser showed the time to be three thirty.
The night was nearly gone when Bob tumbled
into bed and turned off the light on the bedside
stand. In less than a minute he was sound asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s slumber for the first hour was deep and
dreamless. Then his mind, as his body threw off
part of the fatigue, became restless and pictures
of the events of the night flashed through his
brain. Bob stirred restlessly once or twice and
finally aroused enough to mutter in his sleep.</p>
<p>He must have been reliving the vivid struggle
in the darkness of the office for he was tense when
he sat up suddenly&mdash;wide awake and listening for
some sound from the hall.</p>
<p>Sleep vanished from his eyes. There was no
mistake about it. Someone was outside his door,
trying the knob ever so gently. At that moment
Bob longed for some other weapon than his two
capable hands. The side of the bed nearest the
door creaked and Bob knew if he eased his body
over that edge the creaking of the bed might
scare away the marauder. Moving cautiously, he
slid out the side next to the wall and put his bare
feet on the floor.</p>
<p>An alleyway ran back of the apartment and a
street light at the head of this sent just enough
light down to mark the window as a lighter
square against the general pattern of darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>This turning of the doorknob was getting to
be too much for Bob and he cast about for some
object which he could use as a club. His golf
bag was in the corner and he managed to extract
a steel shafted midiron which would make an excellent
weapon if he had a chance to swing it.</p>
<p>There was no thought of fear in Bob&rsquo;s mind
as he moved toward the door. His bare feet
padded softly across the floor and he reached out
and touched the doorknob with his finger tips.
It was moving.</p>
<p>For a moment Bob recoiled like he had been
struck by an electric shock. Then he got a grip
on his nerves and reached down for the key
which he had left in the lock on the inside of the
door.</p>
<p>To his surprise the key was not in the lock.
Then he understood the slight noise that had
aroused him. Whoever was on the other side of
the door had pushed the key out of the lock and
the noise made when it had struck the floor had
brought him out of his sleep.</p>
<p>Bob leaned down and felt along the floor. He
reached out in his search for the key, became
overbalanced, and before he could regain his
equilibrium, dropped to his knees with a thud
that was plainly audible in the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s hands closed on the key he sought, but
as he drew himself upright again he heard someone
running down the hall. Seconds later came
the slam of an outside door and Bob knew that it
would be useless to attempt any pursuit.</p>
<p>He turned on the light and opened the door.
The same dim lights were burning in the hallway.
Closing the door, he was sure that it was locked
and then wedged a chair under the doorknob.</p>
<p>When Bob got back into bed he was a sadly
perplexed young filing clerk. Why should an
attempt be made to enter his room? The riddle
was beyond him. Perhaps his uncle could solve
it in the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XIII</span></span>
<br />BOB FIGHTS BACK<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s nerves were tight. The mystery of the
turning knob had aroused and sharpened
his senses and sleep was slow in coming to
him again. He tossed fitfully on the bed, turning
the pillow several times in an effort to find a more
comfortable place for his head. When he finally
dropped asleep it was just before dawn.</p>
<p>Once asleep, Bob fell into a heavy slumber
that was finally broken by the strident ringing of
the telephone at the stand beside his bed. It was
with an effort that he sat up in bed and reached
sleepily for the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said in a voice still drugged with
sleep.</p>
<p>Then all thoughts of sleep were swept from his
mind by the message which came over the telephone.
It was from his uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The head of the bureau of investigation wants
you to come down for an interview at eleven
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Merritt Hughes. &ldquo;Think you can
make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it now?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there with half an hour to spare,&rdquo;
promised Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything happen?&rdquo; There was a note of
anxiety in the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite. Tell you about it later. Where
will I meet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal agent named an office in the Department
of Justice building and Bob promised
to be there right after breakfast.</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver and piled out of bed.
His muscles were still a little sore as a result of the
encounter of the night before, but a snappy
shower toned up his body and when he finished
dressing he felt that he was ready for anything
the day might have in store in the way of excitement
and adventure.</p>
<p>Bob put on his topcoat and then removed the
chair which he had wedged under the doorknob.
In the cool light of the morning, the events of
the night before seemed fantastic yet he knew
that one man was in jail while another was in a
hospital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Bob stepped into the hall and carefully locked
the door. More or less as a reaction he looked
cautiously up and down the hall and then laughed
at himself. It was just a plain hall and his fears
seemed so ridiculous now.</p>
<p>It was 9:45 o&rsquo;clock when Bob stepped out of
the apartment building. He paused a moment to
turn down the brim of his hat for the glare of the
sun was too bright for unprotected eyes.</p>
<p>Across the street a large, dark sedan was
parked and several men were apparently waiting
for someone to emerge from the apartment house
opposite. Bob turned and strode down the street.
There was ample time for him to have a leisurely
breakfast and still reach the Department of
Justice building with plenty of time to spare.</p>
<p>The young filing clerk stopped at a nearby restaurant
where he usually had breakfast and
ordered rolls and coffee. Several morning papers
were on the table and he scanned them with unusual
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Washington reporters were unusually alert
and it was just possible that they might have received
some hint of what had taken place last
night. Bob went through every page, but there
was no story even remotely connected with the
night before.</p>
<p>He put down the papers and turned to his
breakfast, wondering what the chief of the
bureau of investigation wanted. Of course it
must be linked with the radio document, but Bob
felt that his uncle could adequately give all of the
information needed.</p>
<p>Then another thought flashed through his
head. But it seemed ridiculous. Yet his uncle had
mentioned only the night before that there was a
possibility. Bob&rsquo;s great ambition was to become
an agent of the Department of Justice and in that
ambition Tully Ross was a bitter rival.</p>
<p>Bob finished his breakfast and started walking
toward the Department of Justice building. The
air was bracing and he swung along at a good
pace, unaware of a sedan which was following
at a discreet distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The filing clerk turned a corner and started
down a little used street which was a short-cut
toward his destination. As he turned, the car following
him spurted forward and closed in the distance.
Bob was less than fifty feet down the
block when the car swung around the corner.
The squeal of the tires as the wheels were
cramped caught Bob&rsquo;s attention and he turned
around to look at the sedan.</p>
<p>He recognized the machine instantly. It was
the car which had been parked across the street
from his own apartment house. Something in the
intentness of the driver and the alertness of the
man beside him sent a wave of apprehension
pounding through Bob&rsquo;s veins. He felt sure
that the car was on that street for no good purpose
and he was the only pedestrian in sight.</p>
<p>Bob knew the short street thoroughly. Beside
him was a rather high iron fence that protected a
private home. Just inside the fence was a clump
of barberry so thick they were almost a jungle of
shrubbery. There was no protection across the
street and it was a good two hundred feet to the
intersection where he could hope to obtain help.</p>
<p>Bob heard the car slow down now and he
steeled himself for what he felt was going to be
an unpleasant encounter. Just why he had that
premonition he could never tell, but in later days,
his hunches were to serve him well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The driver of the sedan had a scar on his forehead
while the passenger in the front seat, who
was nearest Bob, had red hair that frizzled out
from beneath a soft felt hat.</p>
<p>The car stopped at the curb and the passenger
jumped out, leaving the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, buddy, I&rsquo;m looking for an address near
here. Maybe you can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m afraid not. I&rsquo;m in a hurry,&rdquo; retorted
Bob, edging a little closer to the iron
picket fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess you&rsquo;re not in such a hurry. Matter
of fact, I&rsquo;ve got a little business with you.
Ain&rsquo;t you a filing clerk down in the archives division
of the War Department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am and then maybe I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo; Bob&rsquo;s
reply was crisp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart guy, huh? Well, I know who you are
and I&rsquo;ve got business with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob measured the other, wondering just how
hard he would have to hit him to knock him out.
The red head was about five feet eight tall, but
was compact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to take a little ride and talk.
See?&rdquo; There was a threat in every word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not riding this morning,&rdquo; he said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him a crack on the noodle and drag him
in,&rdquo; called the man at the wheel of the sedan. He
started to get out of the car and Bob knew that
between the two of them they would be able to
overpower him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked for it,&rdquo; he muttered as his right
swung in a short, hard chop that landed on the
red-head&rsquo;s solar plexus. The blow caught the
other man napping and doubled him up. Bob was
ready for him and a hard cross with his left to
the chin ended all thoughts of a fight which might
have been in the other&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you,&rdquo; yelled the driver. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
get away with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob saw him reaching for his back pocket
and tugging at something. That decided Bob,
who felt sure the other was reaching for a gun.
Putting his hands on the fence, Bob vaulted the
iron barrier.</p>
<p>He landed in the tangle of barberry, but the
shrubbery was so tall that he crashed through and
a protecting thicket shielded him from the eyes
of the man on the other side of the fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Without waiting to see what was happening
in the street, Bob beat his way through the shrubbery.
The thorns tore at his clothes and his hands
were soon streaked with scratches, but his
thought was to get as far away as possible in the
shortest time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XIV</span></span>
<br />SPECIAL AGENT NINE<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>As Bob clawed his way through the dense
shrubbery there was a sharp explosion
behind him. Whether it was a shot or
the exhaust of the sedan was something he didn&rsquo;t
stop to find out.</p>
<p>When he was finally clear of the barberry, Bob
found himself in a small, open yard in front of
the house, which was heavily shuttered and evidently
unoccupied. But Bob wasted no time in
reconnoitering the house. He kept on going,
running around to the rear.</p>
<p>The iron fence enclosed the whole property
but there was a gate and he made for this. A
heavy padlock secured the gate, but Bob scrambled
over without tearing his clothes and dropped
into the alley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>From far behind on the other street he could
hear the heavy roar of an exhaust and he ducked
into a half opened garage on the other side of the
alley for he had no intention of being caught out
in the open.</p>
<p>When the noise of the exhaust finally died
away, Bob went back into the alley. A walk of
a block and a half brought him to a thoroughfare
and he hailed a passing cab, directing that he be
taken to the Department of Justice building.</p>
<p>Once inside the cab, Bob sat back to take
stock of the damage which the thorns of the
barberry had done to his hands. There were half
a dozen raw angry scratches and innumerable
little snags in his suit from the prickly stuff.</p>
<p>When he thought of what had happened in the
last few minutes, Bob frankly admitted that he
was at a loss to account for it. Why should he be
singled out for an attack by a couple of hoodlums?
Why should someone attempt to enter
his room in the night? Perhaps his uncle would
have the key to answers when he met him.</p>
<p>The cab pulled up in front of the Department
of Justice building and Bob paid the driver and
stepped out. Several pedestrians going by looked
at him curiously and he realized that he looked
strangely unkempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>Bob stepped inside the building. His hands
were smarting and he took out two clean handkerchiefs
and wrapped them around his hands.
There was still a little time before his appointment
and he turned around and went to a nearby
drug store where he explained that his hands had
been scratched by barberry. A clerk recommended
an antiseptic solution and Bob washed
his hands thoroughly in this and then wrapped
the handkerchiefs around them again.</p>
<p>Back in the Department of Justice building,
Bob was whisked to an upper floor and a boy
guided him to the room he inquired for. There
was no name on the glass panel of the doorway
and Bob stepped inside, wondering just what
kind of a reception he was going to have. There
was no one in the room when he entered and he
sat down in a chair near a window to wait.</p>
<p>The door opened again and Tully Ross
stepped in and stared at Bob. The surprise was
mutual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to find you here,&rdquo; exclaimed
Tully, and there was no pleasure in his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that goes for me, too,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Tully took a chair a few feet from Bob and
conversation ended right then and there. For at
least ten minutes no word was spoken until an
inner door opened and Merritt Hughes entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Bob. Hello, Tully. You&rsquo;re right on
time. Mr. Edgar will be here in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob had seen Waldo Edgar, chief of the
bureau of investigation of the Department of
Justice several times, but he had never been introduced
to him. Through the exploits of the
bureau in recent months in tracking down some
of the nation&rsquo;s most notorious criminals, Edgar
had become an almost legendary figure for it was
from his office far up in the Department of Justice
building, that he directed, by telephone, telegraph
and radio, the great man hunts for the
violators of the law.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes looked at Bob&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt your hands in the fight last night?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;I got
tangled up in a barberry hedge a few minutes ago
and the thorns almost got the better of me. Guess
I&rsquo;ve ruined this suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What under the sun were you doing in a barberry
hedge?&rdquo; the federal agent wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to get away from a couple of plug-uglies
who seemed to want my company more
than I wanted theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed his uncle incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; retorted Bob with equal insistence. &ldquo;I
was taking a short-cut when a sedan pulled alongside
me and one fellow got out and asked about
an address. It was just a stall to get near me, but
I had seen the car parked earlier just opposite the
apartment. I was suspicious and when I thought
he got insistent I let him have a couple. The
driver started after me and when I thought he
was reaching for a gun I went over the fence and
dove through the barberry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is serious. Have you reported it yet to
the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I thought it was best to come right here
and tell you. I didn&rsquo;t get the number of the car
for I was too busy trying to crash through that
blamed barberry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not important. They&rsquo;ve either abandoned
the car or changed the license plates by this
time. Can you describe the men who were in it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Bob supplied a detailed explanation and his
uncle jotted the facts down on a small card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will give us a lead to work on. Later
we&rsquo;ll go over to the bureau of identification and
run through some pictures of red heads and men
with scars on their foreheads. Maybe we can
pick up some real clues there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was tempted to relate the incident of the
early morning at his room when someone had
tried to gain access, but he hesitated to tell this
in front of Tully. It sounded a little like a fairy
tale or the work of an overwrought imagination.</p>
<p>The door to an inner suite of offices opened
and a dapper, well-built man of about 38 stepped
into the room. Behind him was Condon Adams.</p>
<p>Bob felt his pulse quicken for even before their
introduction he recognized Waldo Edgar, ace of
all the federal manhunters and chief of the
bureau of investigation.</p>
<p>Edgar looked at the handkerchiefs on Bob&rsquo;s
hands and smiled quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just plain barberry thorns,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I take it you weren&rsquo;t strolling on the
barberry just for the fun of the thing,&rdquo; said the
federal chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a stroll,&rdquo; grinned Bob.
&ldquo;It was something like trying to do a hundred
yard dash in nothing flat through half an acre of
barberry. It was a good place to hide, but a poor
place for running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar&rsquo;s eyebrows went up questioningly
and he turned to Merritt Hughes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this tie in with what happened last
night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently. Bob was trailed by a couple of
hoodlums in a car. When he was alone on a side
street they waylaid him, but he knocked one out
and jumped over a fence and ran through a barberry
patch to escape. He came here directly
after that happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else happened since last night?&rdquo;
The question was from the thin, straight lips of
Waldo Edgar and Bob told in detail what had
taken place during the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about this, Bob?&rdquo;
exclaimed his uncle.</p>
<p>Bob flushed. &ldquo;Well, it seemed like I&rsquo;d been
having enough excitement for the last twenty-four
hours and this sounded sort of crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it sounds crazy,&rdquo; snorted Condon
Adams and Bob caught a supercilious sneer flit
across the lips of Tully Ross. It was plain that
neither Adams nor his nephew believed the story
and Bob turned back to the federal chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing crazy about this story. It
only confirms our realization that some tremendously
powerful force is after these radio secrets.
We know now that only a part of the secret
papers were taken from the file last night. The
others had not been sent over from the radio
engineering division of the War Department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could those papers get out of the
office last night?&rdquo; put in Condon Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for you and Hughes here to determine.
You&rsquo;re on this case, but I&rsquo;m going to add a
couple of special agents to help you out. It isn&rsquo;t
that I think you&rsquo;re not capable, but I believe several
inside men in the archives division will be
tremendously helpful to you and I don&rsquo;t want to
have outsiders go in there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Waldo Edgar turned toward Bob and Tully
and looked at them through searching eyes. His
scrutiny of Bob was fairly brief, but he appeared
to be making a more careful appraisal of Tully,
and Bob thought he saw just a flicker of doubt in
the federal chief&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is decidedly irregular for this division to
take on additional men, and especially very
young men, but when we feel a case merits unusual
attention, we do not hesitate to cut away
the red tape and employ the individuals we want
to serve us. Bob, would you consider joining the
bureau of investigation as a provisional agent,
working directly out of my office and solely
upon this radio case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s heart went into his throat and he
choked in answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that very much, sir. I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure that you will. Tully, how about
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great stuff. Count me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would both agree. Wait just a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal chief left the room and when he
returned he had a Bible in one hand and several
small leather cases in another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Place your left hands on the Bible and raise
your right hands,&rdquo; he directed. Then he read a
brief pledge, which they repeated after him.</p>
<p>The pledge administered, Waldo Edgar
handed one of the leather cases to Tully and the
other to Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find your identification cards in
there as well as a small gold badge. Further instructions
will be given you later in the day. I&rsquo;m
expecting a great deal from each of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After shaking hands with each of them he hurried
away and Bob looked down at the identification
card in the leather case. He was now Bob
Houston, Special Agent Nine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XV</span></span>
<br />A REAL JOB AHEAD<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>There was a strange mist in Bob&rsquo;s eyes as
he looked up at his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake, Bob. You&rsquo;ve got a real job
ahead of you and I know you&rsquo;ll come through
with flying colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot. This is the biggest thing that
has ever come to me and I&rsquo;m going to succeed if
it is at all possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a grim sort of a chuckle from Tully
Ross, who had shoved his leather case with its
card and badge into an inside pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to step some if you
think you can put anything over on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully and his uncle left the office and Bob
watched the door close behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice people,&rdquo; he grinned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the looks of this case,&rdquo; said his
uncle. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t pleasant to think that you&rsquo;ve got
someone else in the same department, who goes
out of his way to make it unpleasant for you,
working on the same case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why is Adams assigned to team up with
you?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps because we have a habit of getting results,&rdquo;
admitted Merritt Hughes, with a rueful
smile. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been pretty lucky on a number of
cases where we have worked together. The
breaks have been about fifty-fifty and now we
both want a really smashing victory that will
bring us advancement. It looks like this may be
the case, but it&rsquo;s going to be dangerous business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look back over the events of the last
few hours. We know that an important paper,
containing part of a new radio discovery, was
sent over to your department from the radio
engineering division. Before it can be properly
filed, a guard is overpowered and two offices ransacked
to find this paper. Later in the night
another attempt is made to enter your room and
this morning there was an attempt to kidnap you.
Looks to me like you&rsquo;re in a key position, but
I don&rsquo;t know just what it is yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit the attempt to get into my room last
night and the trouble this morning have me worried,&rdquo;
said Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a filing clerk so why
such attention should be centered on me is a
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked out into the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop at the bureau of identification and
see if we can learn anything about the fellows
who tried to kidnap you,&rdquo; said the federal agent.</p>
<p>They dropped down a floor and entered a
long room where a number of clerks were working
at filing cases.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes walked up to a slender chap
busy at a flat-topped desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look alive, Jimmy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s business
at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmy Adel, chief of the filing division,
looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, sleuth. Who are you trailing this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One red head and one fellow with a scar on
his forehead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t that a lot of help! Don&rsquo;t you know
that there are a good many red heads and a whole
lot of people with scars on their foreheads? Just
be a little more exact, please.&rdquo; But he grinned as
he chided the federal agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy, this is my nephew, Bob Houston.
He&rsquo;s detailed to help me on a new case that&rsquo;s
breaking pretty fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The radio case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;s all over the department. Looks big
to me. Adams working on it too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means you&rsquo;ll have to step fast. I hear
that whoever solves this thing will be in line for
an inspectorship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re right, Jimmy, because Bob and
I are going to clear up this mystery. That is, if
you&rsquo;ll give us a little help. A couple of hoodlums
tried to kidnap Bob a while ago. He can give
you an accurate description of them and you may
be able to pull their pictures out of the files.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find them for you if they&rsquo;ve any record
at all.&rdquo; He pulled a blank form from a file and
fired question after question at Bob on height,
weight, color of eyes, and any possible peculiarities
which they might have had. When he had
finished both forms, he leaned back in his chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call that an almost perfect description of
these chaps. If we don&rsquo;t dig them out of the files,
I&rsquo;ll miss my bet. We&rsquo;ll get something for you
before midnight. Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob and his uncle left the identification bureau
and took an elevator down to the main floor.
Bob&rsquo;s hands still smarted from the scratches they
had suffered from the barberry and he kept the
handkerchiefs wrapped around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to drop in at the police station and
question the man caught last night,&rdquo; said Merritt
Hughes, &ldquo;but we can stop at your apartment on
our way down and give it the once-over. We
might find something of interest in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal agent flagged a taxi and they sped
swiftly toward Bob&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how does it feel to be a federal agent,
even though you&rsquo;re only a provisional one?&rdquo;
his uncle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite used to it,&rdquo; replied Bob, taking
out the small leather case and extracting the card
and badge which it contained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>He turned the badge over carefully in his
fingers. His name was engraved on the back and
behind this small emblem stood the mighty law
enforcement machinery of Uncle Sam. Bob
thrilled even though he was as yet a small and
comparatively unimportant part of that great
system, which was rapidly building up a worldwide
reputation for &ldquo;getting its man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes settled back in the cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is likely to be a rather long-drawn out
case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and from the way it&rsquo;s started,
it may be extremely dangerous. When it comes
to that, I want you to step aside and let the regular
agents take the chances. Do you understand,
Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not afraid of trouble,&rdquo; insisted Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t it. When the pinches come we
want men who have been tried under fire in
there. You&rsquo;ll be used as an inside man in the
archives division and in that capacity you are
going to be highly important. There must have
been a leak somewhere, else how would it have
been known that a part of the new radio development
had been sent over for filing? It will be up
to you to find where this information leaked before
Tully Ross and Condon Adams learn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal agent paused a moment, before
continuing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After we find the leak in your department,
we&rsquo;ll have something to work back on. That
should lead us to the man or the men who now
have the papers that disappeared last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the man arrested last night be the key
to that?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but I hardly believe so. Usually
the boys who do the rough stuff in a case like
this know little of what is really going on. But
we&rsquo;ll see him a little later. No use in letting
anything slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab slowed down in front of the apartment
house and Bob&rsquo;s uncle paid the taxi bill.</p>
<p>They walked up to the third floor and then
back along the corridor to the door which opened
into Bob&rsquo;s room. The door was slightly ajar and
Merritt Hughes was about to push it open when
Bob seized his arm and put his finger on his lips.
Then he pulled his uncle back several steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That door was locked when I left,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes looked startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question about it,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then keep back and let me go ahead.&rdquo; It
was a whispered command that Bob dared not
disobey and he saw his uncle reach under his
left arm and draw a revolver from a shoulder
holster.</p>
<p>They stepped close to the wall and again advanced
toward the door, treading silently on the
heavy carpet of the corridor. There was no
sound of anyone moving about inside the room,
but Merritt Hughes did not believe in taking
unnecessary chances.</p>
<p>After listening a moment at the door, he
reached out with one foot and gave it a hard
shove inward, at the same time leaping into the
doorway, gun in hand and ready for action.</p>
<p>It was a breathless moment for Bob until he
saw his uncle lower the weapon and nod to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here and take a look at your room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XVI</span></span>
<br />IN BOB&rsquo;S ROOM<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob stepped through the doorway, and
stopped involuntarily. The interior of
his room looked like a young cyclone had
been turned loose on a spring afternoon. Every
drawer in the dresser had been pulled out and
its contents dumped on the floor, the bedding was
strewn about the room and the mattress had been
ripped open and even his clothes had been taken
out of the closet and scattered about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends of yours must have been disappointed
because you weren&rsquo;t at home,&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>
<p>Bob sat down in a chair and took another look
around. Nothing in the room had been spared.
Even the pictures had been taken off the walls
and the backs ripped out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>He looked down at a coat which had been
dropped beside the chair. The pockets had been
turned inside out and the lining of the garment
had been torn and ripped. The coat was ruined
and Bob felt hot tears of anger welling into his
eyes. His fists doubled up involuntarily. Someone
would have to pay for this, he told himself.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes touched his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your chin up, Bob. This is kind of
tough and it looks plain malicious to me, but
your time will come. I&rsquo;m just wondering why
all of this attention is being centered on you. I
can&rsquo;t make myself believe that they are trying
to get even with you because you spoiled the
game last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t. The paper is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s gone from the files, but they may
not have their hands on it yet. Sure you made a
thorough search down below the building last
night? It couldn&rsquo;t have been caught in the shrubbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure about that. We went over every
inch of space and found half of the gum wrappers
in Washington,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could feel sure that the paper has
not gotten into the hands of the men who are
after it. From what&rsquo;s gone on today I&rsquo;m inclined
to believe there has been a slip somewhere.
We know the paper is missing from the files but
we&rsquo;re not sure that the man who took it was able
to deliver it outside before you caught him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he did. His only chance would
have been to have dropped it from the window
and that would have been too risky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might have placed it in a marked container
of some kind and have had a confederate
waiting below,&rdquo; suggested the federal agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible, but when Arthur Jacobs and
I searched last night we couldn&rsquo;t even find fresh
footprints under the windows. Of course there
were some near the window where the guard was
trussed up, but if the paper had been dropped in
a container, there should have been footprints
directly below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain might have erased them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. The ground under the shrubbery
is unusually soft and I noticed how deep our own
prints were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes sat down on the bed and it
was a long time before he asked Bob another
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about Tully? Could he
possibly have taken that paper out of the file?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless he was a magician and I don&rsquo;t
think Tully would do a thing like that. He&rsquo;s
wild and headstrong, but he wouldn&rsquo;t go that far.
Why that&rsquo;s working against Uncle Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, but some people aren&rsquo;t bothered
by scruples like that. Well, if we&rsquo;re sure the
paper wasn&rsquo;t tossed out the window, it narrows
down to three people&mdash;the man you caught, Tully
and yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t take that paper,&rdquo; smiled Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I know that and so does
Waldo Edgar, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have made you
a provisional agent. But Condon Adams is as
anxious to solve this case as I am and he may try
to hang something around your neck. Remember,
that only three of you were in the room and
that paper disappeared in some manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it in that way,&rdquo; reflected
Bob. &ldquo;It does put me in a pretty serious light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I have been so anxious that you
be assigned to work with me on this case. I
had a long talk with Edgar this morning. I&rsquo;d
told him of your ambition to eventually join the
service and pointed out that you might well prove
invaluable as an inside man on this case. He
agreed with me and of course when Condon
Adams put up about the same kind of a proposition
in behalf of Tully, he couldn&rsquo;t say no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know where Adams gets all his
pull,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of it is due to ability and part of it to
powerful political friends,&rdquo; explained his uncle.
&ldquo;The senator from Adams&rsquo; home state is high
up in administration circles and in addition is a
firm friend of this department. He&rsquo;s helped get
us the additional appropriations we&rsquo;ve needed to
expand and equip the department properly and
of course the chief can&rsquo;t ignore that when Adams
puts the pressure on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; admitted Bob, &ldquo;but it seems
unfair to the other men who have no political
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His is about the only case in the department
in which that is true,&rdquo; said his uncle. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s
competent, too. Don&rsquo;t mistake that. I&rsquo;ll have
to keep on my toes if I run this radio mystery
down before he does.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All of which means that I am the inside man
for you while Tully is to serve his uncle in whatever
inside capacity he can in our department,&rdquo;
said Bob. &ldquo;I can see where there is going to be
some intense rivalry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, either Adams or myself should benefit
by it,&rdquo; smiled the federal agent. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t
kill each other trying to dig out facts and get
them to us first. Now we&rsquo;d better find out what
we can about the invasion here. How about your
landlords?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re down in Virginia on a vacation. The
only person likely to know anything about this
is the janitor,&rdquo; explained Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me down to him,&rdquo; directed his uncle.</p>
<p>Bob looked ruefully at the room. There
wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot that could be salvaged, for his
clothing was ruined and one of the suits had
been practically new. He could see his savings
account going down almost to the vanishing
point.</p>
<p>They stepped out into the hall and Bob started
to lock the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. I want a look at that doorknob,&rdquo;
said his uncle. He took a small but powerful
glass from his coat pocket and examined the
doorknob. When he stood up he shook his
head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever opened that door was wearing
gloves. That means if they were that smart there
isn&rsquo;t much use to check over the interior of the
rooms for fingerprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any sign of the door being forced?&rdquo; asked
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. A skeleton key must have been used.
Lead on; we&rsquo;ll see the janitor now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the janitor in the basement and
when Bob explained their mission he readily assented
to answer their questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers?&rdquo; he said, repeating the question
the federal agent asked. &ldquo;Yes, a couple of them
called about an hour ago. They wanted to know
where Mr. Houston lived and I took them up to
the third floor back. They said they had been
sent to get some papers he had left at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they get in?&rdquo; the question shot from
the lips of the federal agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they had a key,&rdquo; explained the janitor.
&ldquo;One of them said Mr. Houston had given them
his key. It worked all right and I didn&rsquo;t think
any more about it. I was having trouble with
the furnace smoking, so I came right back down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And left them alone in Bob&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; the
agent pressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. They seemed to know what
they were about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did they stay up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know. I went up to that floor
a few minutes ago, but no one was in sight then.
Maybe they were there half an hour; maybe
only five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The janitor scratched his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I didn&rsquo;t pay a whole lot of attention
to them. One of them was a lot taller
than the other one, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A premonition had been growing on Bob and
he couldn&rsquo;t repress his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the taller one have red hair?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it, he did,&rdquo; replied the
janitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the shorter one; was there a scar on his
forehead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Friends of yours, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly friends,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember anything else about them?&rdquo; asked
Merritt Hughes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not right now, anyhow,&rdquo; said the janitor and
they left him to return to his work while they
went outdoors.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there is no question about the identity
of your visitors. They are the same ones who
attempted to kidnap you. What&rsquo;s the reason for
all of your popularity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I knew,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Believe me,
it is no fun to have your room torn apart like
that. Why they ruined my clothes and it&rsquo;s
going to be mighty costly getting them repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you out if you&rsquo;re pinched for
money,&rdquo; volunteered his uncle, reaching for his
billfold.</p>
<p>But Bob waved the offer aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I&rsquo;ll get along all right. If I ever
catch up with those fellows they&rsquo;ll have to get
their fists into action pretty fast if they want to
escape a thorough drubbing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you a bit for feeling that way.
But we&rsquo;ve got to get along. I have an appointment
with one of the army&rsquo;s chief radio engineers
in less than fifteen minutes and I want you
to sit in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They signalled for a cab and started for the
meeting which was to reveal some startling information
on Bob&rsquo;s first case.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XVII</span></span>
<br />THE RADIO SECRET<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Merritt Hughes leaned back in the
seat as the cab darted in and out of
the heavy traffic on the avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the breaks have been against us so
far,&rdquo; he mused, half to himself and half to Bob,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;re bound to find something coming our
way soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to see the fellow who is being held
at the police station,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;ll
be able to get some information out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember you&rsquo;re working on this case, too.
Better say &rsquo;we&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;you&rsquo; when you&rsquo;re
talking about it. This is the firm of Hughes and
Houston, working for Uncle Sam on a radio
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Their cab pulled up in front of the War Department
and they entered and hastened to an
upper floor where the federal agent rapped
sharply on a door marked &ldquo;Major Francis McCreary,
Private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; a heavy voice on the other side
rumbled and Merritt Hughes opened the door.</p>
<p>Bob, looking in, saw a heavy man, a huge
thatch of hair bristling over his forehead, at a
flat-topped desk. He rose as they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Hughes,&rdquo; greeted the major. &ldquo;Right
on time.&rdquo; He nodded toward a desk clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made it with nothing to spare,&rdquo; grinned Bob&rsquo;s
uncle. Then he added, &ldquo;Major, I want you to
know my nephew, Bob Houston. He&rsquo;s working
with me on this case. Bob&rsquo;s the man who captured
our radio thief last night and I&rsquo;m counting
on him as a valuable inside man in the department
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you,&rdquo; boomed the major, offering
a warm handclasp. &ldquo;Are you in the Department
of Justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob started to reply but his uncle spoke first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the filing division right now, but he&rsquo;s
also a provisional agent and I&rsquo;m expecting he&rsquo;ll
join the service permanently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The major shuffled several papers on his desk
and picked up one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a copy of the paper stolen last night,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I know you want the gist of its importance
and why so much interest attaches to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved them toward chairs and dropped
back in his own swivel seat, which he filled to
overflowing with his generous bulk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been making some real strides in our
army radio development,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and
some other powers have been watching us closely.
There&rsquo;s no need to mention names right now until
suspicion definitely points to a nation. What we
have actually perfected in recent weeks is a workable
radio control for robot operated bombing
planes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a moment to let the significance of
his statement sink in.</p>
<p>Bob knew its importance. Of course there had
long been talk that such a device was possible,
but it had never been perfected so far as he knew.
Its value as a weapon of destruction was tremendous
for airplanes loaded with high explosives
could be dispatched over great distances and
then made to drop their deadly cargoes upon a
radio signal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Bob glanced at his uncle. Merritt Hughes
was sitting on the edge of his chair, waiting for
the army officer to continue.</p>
<p>Major McCreary cleared his throat and Bob
sensed that he was laboring under a definite strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project has been a pet of mine for years.
I&rsquo;ve encountered one discouragement after another
and it was only two months ago that I
struck the right track. Since then my developments
have been almost sensational.&rdquo; He paused
a moment as though fearing they might feel he
was bragging about his own accomplishments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actual tests last week proved the practicability
of my invention and I then set it down in
detail for final filing. Of course we knew that
other powers were aware of the line along which
the experiments had been carried out, but our
real source of worry was that they might get their
hands on the actual details of operation. For that
reason it was decided to file the material in various
sections and to make no special fuss about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the paper stolen last night was the first
section of your file?&rdquo; asked Merritt Hughes,
restraining his eagerness no longer.</p>
<p>The army officer nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right. It was the original. The one on my
desk is a copy. The other originals are in a safe
in this building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there enough information on the first section
which was stolen to reveal your plan in full?&rdquo;
asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something that would depend upon the
cleverness of the men into whose hands it is
delivered. There is one European power whose
radio experts are well advanced along the line
on which I have been working. If this document
is delivered into their hands, there is a good
chance that it contains information which would
be of value to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But so far we have no idea who is behind the
theft last night,&rdquo; said the federal agent. &ldquo;Have
you any hunches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major McCreary shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing strong enough to give you any leads.
But I&rsquo;ll let you know the minute anything develops.
In the meantime, make every effort to
recover this paper. Once it passes beyond the
boundaries of this country it may fall into the
hands of men smart enough and unscrupulous
enough to learn its meaning and put it to their
own selfish use. It is a secret which would give
them unlimited powers of destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>After they had left Major McCreary&rsquo;s office
Bob looked at his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the police station to interview that prisoner
without any further loss of time,&rdquo; was the
decision.</p>
<p>The station was some distance away and they
took a taxi. Before they had gone three blocks
the hooting of police sirens fairly filled the air
and their driver was forced to pull far over to
the right as radio cars went racing past, each
driver tense at his wheel and the other officer
ready with a shotgun in his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something big&rsquo;s broken,&rdquo; said the federal
agent. &ldquo;Be just my luck to have it an angle on
this case. Oh well, we might as well go on to
the station and see what we can dig out of your
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they reached the police station another
squad car rushed away, its siren screaming a warning
to traffic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Merritt Hughes fairly tossed the cab fare at
the driver and with Bob at his heels, ran into the
building. The federal agent knew the desk sergeant
and directed his questions at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Barney? Bank been robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about as bad. Someone slugged one of
your agents and made a break. Matter of fact,
I guess it was a friend of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit kidding, Barney. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow you caught last night was being
questioned by Condon Adams when all of a sudden
he ups and smashes Adams a nasty crack on
the chin, grabs his gun, and legs it out the door.
We&rsquo;ve got every squad car in town out hunting
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob felt his own heart sink for he knew that
unless the fugitive was recaptured, their hopes
for a real break in the radio mystery were slim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XVIII</span></span>
<br />MEAGER HOPES<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Merritt Hughes stared hard at the
police sergeant as though he dared
not believe the officer&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that again, Barney. There must be some
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; grinned the sergeant. &ldquo;Condon
Adams made a mistake in questioning that fellow
alone. Things certainly happened fast and
furiously around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal agent shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re certainly not getting the breaks in this
case,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Adams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out with one of the radio patrols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any idea where this fellow went when
he made his break from the station here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He forced a passing motorist to pick him up,
but we didn&rsquo;t even get a good description of the
car. Oh, it was a smooth job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Merritt Hughes turned to his nephew and Bob
saw an expression of almost despair in his face.
Then it was gone in a moment, and in its place
was a set look of determination which Bob had
often seen when his uncle was working on a big
case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything I can do to help you here?&rdquo; the
federal agent asked the desk sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, unless this fellow comes back and
tries to steal the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go along to the hospital and have
a talk with the guard who was attacked last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they left the police station they could hear
the echo of the sirens in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;ll get away?&rdquo; asked Bob, who had
spoken only once or twice during the entire time
they had been in the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, especially since the police have
no description of the car he commandeered,&rdquo;
replied Merritt Hughes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>When they reached the hospital, they were
shown immediately to the room where the guard
was a patient. He was a middle-aged man, his
dark hair streaked with grey and there was a
bandage around his forehead where he had received
a particularly painful blow from his assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he be interviewed?&rdquo; the federal agent
asked the nurse on duty in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t talk too long,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Bob glimpsed the chart at the foot of the
bed and learned that the guard&rsquo;s name was Max Chervinka,
and that he was fifty-three years old.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes sat down beside the bed, while
Bob, behind him, leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask all the questions,&rdquo; the federal agent
told the guard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk unless you have to.
Just nod a little in answer and that will do.
Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you noticed anything suspicious about
the building recently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was negative. Then the federal
agent plunged into his questions, how had the
attack taken place, what did the man look like,
was there more than one, had he seen anything
of a paper which might have been tossed from
an upper window?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The answers were definite. The guard could
not describe his assailant, as far as he knew there
had been only one man, and he had not seen anything
of a paper thrown from a window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been offered anything to let
anyone in the building who had no business
there?&rdquo; The federal agent rapped out this question
sharply and Bob knew that his uncle attached
great importance to the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; The guard&rsquo;s reply, though in a
weak voice, was definite. &ldquo;There was never any
trouble until last night,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The nurse re-entered the room, noticed the
bright eyes and the flushed cheeks of her patient,
and spoke to the federal agents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s had all of the exertion he can
stand for a while,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Later, perhaps this
evening, you might call again if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anyone else been here?&rdquo; asked Merritt
Hughes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t allow anyone to see him unless
he can identify himself as a Department of
Justice agent,&rdquo; he instructed.</p>
<p>When they were down on the main floor, Bob
spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you instruct the nurse like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just playing safe. We know that the guard
didn&rsquo;t see enough of his assailant to identify him,
but other members of that gang don&rsquo;t know that.
There is no use in exposing that fellow to any
unnecessary risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were outside once more, Bob
voiced another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go down to your own office and step
back into the routine. But keep your eyes open.
Listen to everything that is going on, but don&rsquo;t
let anyone get anything out of you. Phone me
before you leave this afternoon to go home. I
don&rsquo;t want you gallivanting around this town all
alone. The next time some of your &rsquo;friends&rsquo; may
come along and there may not be a fence and a
thicket of barberry handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a taxi home; you won&rsquo;t need to come
for me,&rdquo; protested Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to take a taxi home and
you&rsquo;re not going home. Until this thing is
cleared up you&rsquo;re going to stay with me. Then
if anyone decides to pay us a visit in the middle
of the night we&rsquo;ll give them a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know if anything big breaks,&rdquo; urged
Bob, and his uncle promised to do this.</p>
<p>After their parting, Bob walked down the
street alone. A police car sped by, but its siren
was not sounding an alarm, and Bob wondered
if the rush of the first chase for the escaped prisoner
was over.</p>
<p>As he hurried toward the archives building, he
pondered the events of the last 24 hours. It
seemed almost incredible that so much could
have happened; that he could have been involved
in so many different and exciting things. And
now he was a federal agent. True he was only
on provisional duty, but if he made good, there
was an excellent chance that he would become
a permanent member of the great crime-fighting
organization.</p>
<p>His uncle had been right&mdash;so far the breaks
had all been against them and now the one man
on whom they had been counting for information
had slipped away. But Bob couldn&rsquo;t help a
grin as he thought of the chagrin which Condon
Adams must be suffering now. It would be hard
to explain that escape from the very heart of a
police station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Bob turned into the building where his own office
was located and took the elevator to the top
floor.</p>
<p>When he entered the office he almost bumped
into Arthur Jacobs, the filing chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; asked Jacobs anxiously and Bob
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the prisoner captured last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; demanded the filing chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just escaped from the police station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re sunk,&rdquo; groaned the filing chief.
&ldquo;That means that paper is gone for good and I&rsquo;ll
bet my job is too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. Give the federal men
a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve had nearly 24 hours,&rdquo; wailed the
chubby Jacobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect them to do miracles in that
length of time,&rdquo; cautioned Bob.</p>
<p>Before the filing chief could reply, the door
swung inward and Tully Ross hurried in.</p>
<p>His face was flushed and he appeared to be
laboring under some great excitement.</p>
<p>Arthur Jacobs looked at his watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You might just as well have taken the whole
day off,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I will,&rdquo; retorted Tully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s about enough from you,&rdquo; said
the filing chief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find plenty of extra work
for you to do and you may change your attitude
and show a little respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dark wave of color swept over Tully&rsquo;s face
and Bob saw his fists clench. He stepped closer
to Jacobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get here just when I please,&rdquo; he stormed,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to let you boss me
around. I&rsquo;m a federal agent now and I&rsquo;m working
on a big case. Don&rsquo;t you forget that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of the bravado, Arthur Jacobs
stood his ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you are,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;As
far as I know you&rsquo;re nothing but a clerk in my
department and you&rsquo;ll get to work on time and
you&rsquo;ll be respectful or you&rsquo;ll get another job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m a federal agent, ask
Bob; he&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The filing chief turned to Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tully is right. I saw him sworn into the
service today,&rdquo; said Bob. He was glad that Jacobs
had not asked him about his own position.</p>
<p>Tully seemed satisfied and his anger subsided
when Jacobs once more told him to go to his desk
and start work.</p>
<p>Bob glanced at the other clerks in the room.
All of them had been covertly watching the entire
proceedings. Bob felt that they were all
trustworthy, but he felt better in knowing that
they were not aware that he was a federal agent.
Such knowledge might have spoiled any later efforts
of his to gain information from them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XIX</span></span>
<br />THE MISSING PAPER<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>The affairs of the filing office gradually returned
to routine with Bob and Tully
once more at their desks. There was a
tremendous amount of work to be done, for
hundreds upon hundreds of papers had been removed
from their usual places in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of the
night before. Bob realized that it would take
days for them all to be restored to their places
and he rather hoped, as he contemplated the long
and tedious task, that his uncle would have work
for him to do that would take him outside the
office.</p>
<p>As the afternoon waned Bob tried to analyze
the character of the other clerks in the office. He
had known them casually for more than a year
now, but until this time he had never really tried
to probe into their inner characters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>It was a task that he was particularly well fitted
to do, for he had a rare gift of discernment
of character and anything untrue in another usually
sounded an alarm bell in Bob&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>One by one he checked them off his list of possible
suspects in connection with the disappearance
of the radio paper. Could one of them
have tipped off anyone outside? It was an unpleasant
possibility, but Bob knew that in his
new work he would be up against many unpleasant
things.</p>
<p>The list narrowed down until Bob&rsquo;s eyes rested
on Tully&rsquo;s broad shoulders. The other was
hunched over his desk, apparently gazing through
a nearby window and certainly not much concerned
with the work on the desk in front of
him.</p>
<p>Was Tully linked up with the mystery? Could
he have been the one inside who had learned
of the arrival of the precious paper and given
the information to someone outside?</p>
<p>Bob didn&rsquo;t want to believe that, yet he had
checked all of the others off his list. His eyes
rested on Arthur Jacobs, the filing chief. Could
it have been Jacobs? It was possible, but Bob
scouted serious consideration of the thought, for
Jacobs&rsquo; heart was too much in his work and his
pride was too great for such a deed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Bob felt up against a blank wall. It was his
job to sit tight in the office on the supposition
that someone inside must have given out information.
He felt now that there was little chance
that this had been the case. There were plenty
of other loopholes for the information to leak
out and Bob was convinced that it must have
leaked before the paper came into the filing office.</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock the other clerks left their desks,
but Tully, Bob and the filing chief lingered in
the office.</p>
<p>Jacobs spoke to Tully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you&rsquo;re doing outside this
office,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but as long as you&rsquo;re here and
at your desk you&rsquo;ll have to work. I don&rsquo;t believe
you did five minutes work this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully&rsquo;s eyes dropped and he studied the toes
of his shoes. His voice was heavy when he
spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know I didn&rsquo;t get much work done,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;But I was so blamed excited over being
a federal agent and then trying to figure out how
this information could have leaked out. I&rsquo;ll be
back to earth again tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that for we need your help in
getting this mess straightened out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tully nodded and went on, while Bob hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted just a word with you alone,&rdquo; he told
the filing chief. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything earlier,
but I&rsquo;m also working on this case as a provisional
federal agent. That means I&rsquo;m on probation. If
I make good on this case there may be a permanent
job waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather thought you might be,&rdquo; smiled Jacobs,
&ldquo;after Tully blurted out that he was a special
agent. I kind of put two and two together
and it looked like it would be mighty strange if
Tully were selected and not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be necessary for me to be away from
the office at various times,&rdquo; went on Bob, &ldquo;but
if I can&rsquo;t get word to you, my uncle will see that
you are advised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything that really looks like a clue turned
up?&rdquo; asked Jacobs.</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not as far as I know, and I guess if there
had been I wouldn&rsquo;t be at liberty to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacobs put on his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming down tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve some routine I can get out of the way,&rdquo;
replied Bob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have lunch nearby and will
be able to get through in a couple of hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should come back, but I&rsquo;m all in. Don&rsquo;t
work too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The filing chief stepped out of the office and
closed the door behind him and Bob was left
alone in the long, high-ceilinged office. The room
was in heavy shadows already, for the day had
been cloudy and twilight had come early. He
turned on the light over his desk, decided that
he was hungry, snapped it off, put on his coat
and left the office. At the door he turned and
made sure that the room was securely locked.
Then he walked rapidly down the corridor,
turned, and signalled for an elevator.</p>
<p>Bob was walking through the main doors when
someone hailed him and he saw his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to eat?&rdquo; asked Merritt Hughes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just about half a ton of food,&rdquo; grinned Bob.
&ldquo;It seems ages since I had anything, yet it was
only a few hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Charge that up to excitement,&rdquo; replied his
uncle, as they strode along together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news of the man who broke out of the
police station?&rdquo; There was a real note of anxiety
in Bob&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word. He must have been a magician.
The police are still combing the city, but
I doubt if they&rsquo;ll find him. He belongs to too
clever a gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where could he hide so securely in Washington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An embassy, possibly,&rdquo; shrugged the federal
agent.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s eyes widened. It had never occurred to
him that a representative of a foreign government
would give shelter to a criminal. Yet he
knew that any one of half a dozen foreign powers
would give a great deal to possess the new
radio secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take that suggestion too seriously,&rdquo;
warned Merritt Hughes, who guessed the trend
of Bob&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>He leaned closer to Bob. &ldquo;This case is causing
all kinds of trouble. The entire War Department
is in a furore and I hear special intelligence
officers are being assigned to see if they
can&rsquo;t ferret it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean they don&rsquo;t think the Justice
Department capable of solving the mystery?&rdquo;
asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that, I guess. It simply means
that this case is of such tremendous importance
that everything the government can do will be
done in its solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned into a quiet restaurant and selected
a table well to the rear where they could
talk without danger of being overheard for there
were only a few diners in the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Condon Adams?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>The federal agent shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear he&rsquo;s having a pretty hard time of it.
The chief had him in on the carpet and gave him
a going over for letting this fellow slip away from
him. But it could have happened to anyone. If
we&rsquo;d gotten there first instead of Adams, we
might have been the victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ordered their dinners and Bob leaned
across the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out everyone in the
office,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t find a single one on
whom you can pin any suspicion. The leak about
that paper must have come from outside before
the paper reached us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; nodded his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember that another office was rifled before
our own was visited,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;That
should indicate that the marauder had none too
clear information on where to look for the
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve hit a point I&rsquo;ve been considering.
The more I think about it the more convinced
I become that the leak came before the paper
reached your filing room. That means our job
will be complicated. Maybe we&rsquo;ll get a break one
of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner was served and they ate heartily, ignoring
for the time the case that had enfolded both
of them in its mysterious tangle.</p>
<p>The dinner at an end, Bob leaned back in his
chair and shoved his hands in his coat pockets.
The fingers of his right hand crinkled a stiff sheet
of paper and he drew it out and placed it on
the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>It was not an unusual sheet, at first glance, being
about eight inches wide and eleven inches
long, but it was of heavy material, probably a
pure rag paper.</p>
<p>But it was not the paper that caught and held
Bob&rsquo;s attention. It was the crest of the War Department
which was centered at the top of the
page.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes saw Bob staring at the paper
and looked at his nephew curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Bob? Forget to file something
this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bob did not answer at once, he reached
over and picked up the paper. It was his turn
to stare at the sheet and his eyes widened as he
looked up at his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens, Bob. Where did this come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea. I put my hands in my
pockets just now and the paper was in the right
hand pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know what this is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I know. It&rsquo;s the missing
paper with the radio secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XX</span></span>
<br />ON A LONELY STREET<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Uncle and nephew stared at each other
across the litter of dishes and for a moment
neither was able to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, Bob, how did you get mixed up in this
thing? What have you done?&rdquo; There was anxiety
and agony in every word that came from the
lips of the federal agent.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you don&rsquo;t think I took this? I
couldn&rsquo;t have done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His uncle waved his hands impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Bob. Of course that wasn&rsquo;t what I
meant. I spoke hastily. You&rsquo;re clean enough in
this thing. What I want to know is how did
that paper get into your coat pocket and how
long has it been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish I knew,&rdquo; retorted Bob, the color
surging back into his cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>He stared steadily at the paper on the table
before him. It was incredible that it could have
been in his coat pocket all during the long hours
of the frantic search for it. Yet it must have been,
for there had been no opportunity for anyone
to slip it into his coat recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the discovery of the paper in your
pocket explains the mysterious attacks which have
been aimed at you,&rdquo; said his uncle slowly. &ldquo;Certainly
it was the reason for the rifling of your
room and the attempt to kidnap you this morning.
What a dumb-bell I was not to have guessed
something like this before. It&rsquo;s as plain as day
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could see it that way,&rdquo; replied Bob,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper has been in your pocket ever since
you encountered that marauder in the office last
night. During the tussle he slipped it into your
coat pocket when he realized that his capture was
inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds plausible,&rdquo; agreed Bob. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t I search my own clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because that was the last place in the world
we would have surmised that paper had been hidden.
What chumps we have been.&rdquo; The federal
agent look gloomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we might as well get going.
We&rsquo;ll report this directly to the chief and see
what he has to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he be on the job during the evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a case like this breaks he practically
lives in his office. He&rsquo;ll be there all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the restaurant, secured a taxi, and
drove rapidly toward the Department of Justice
building.</p>
<p>Bob, catching the reflection of lights behind
them in the mirror at the front, looked back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s following us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The federal agent turned quickly. There was
no mistake. A car several hundred feet to the
rear was making every turn their own machine
took.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes leaned ahead and spoke to the
driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re being trailed. Step on it. I&rsquo;ll take
care of any officers who try to stop us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doin&rsquo;, mister. I&rsquo;m not getting myself
into trouble. We&rsquo;re stopping right here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>The driver slammed on the brakes and swung
his car toward the curb, but a curt command from
Bob&rsquo;s uncle stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get this car under way. I&rsquo;m a federal agent
and I&rsquo;m in no mood to have you playing any
tricks. Wheel this buggy for the Department
of Justice building and make it snappy.&rdquo; At
the same time he thrust the little emblem of his
office under the driver&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>The motor of the taxi roared as the driver
tramped on the accelerator and their vehicle
leaped ahead, widening the distance between the
car which was trailing them. They took a corner
so fast the tires screeched in protest and
Bob wondered whether the other machine would
be able to make the turn.</p>
<p>Looking back he saw the car swing wildly,
veer toward the far side of the street, and finally
straighten out in pursuit of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to spell &rsquo;trouble&rsquo; with capital letters,&rdquo;
said the federal agent as he joined Bob in
peering out the window. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better
give me that paper. They know you&rsquo;ve got it
and if we get in a jam they&rsquo;ll try and get it away
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Bob handed over the paper and his uncle slipped
it into a small leather portfolio which he
carried in an inside pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>The taxi swung wildly around another corner
and the brakes screeched as a string of red
lights barred their way. The street was undergoing
repairs.</p>
<p>The driver of their vehicle jammed on his
brakes just as the pursuing machine lurched
around the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on going!&rdquo; cried Bob&rsquo;s uncle, grabbing
the driver by the shoulder and shaking him
roughly. &ldquo;Keep on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a command the driver dared not disobey,
and their car leaped ahead once more, aimed
straight at the first of the red lights.</p>
<p>Their headlights revealed a wooden barrier,
but there was no stopping now and the taxi
crashed into the stringers. Several red lights were
bowled over as the barrier went down. Then
they were bouncing along over the uneven paving,
the wheels dropping into deep ruts.</p>
<p>Bob turned and looked behind them. The pursuing
car had stopped at the barrier and he could
see men leaping out. It was evident that they
intended to pursue the chase, even on foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wrecking this car,&rdquo; cried the taxi driver
in protest as they struck a particularly deep rut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep going; don&rsquo;t worry about the car!&rdquo;
cried Merritt Hughes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out
of this trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engine of the taxi groaned in protest of the
punishment which it was undergoing, but it labored
on, dragging the heavy vehicle out of one
hole and into another.</p>
<p>Bob kept his eyes on the pursuers, who were
now plainly revealed in the lights from the other
car. They seemed to be gaining on the struggling
taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better take a chance on foot,&rdquo; he
warned his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little ways to the end of this construction
work. If we can get that far, we&rsquo;ll
soon outdistance them,&rdquo; replied Merritt Hughes.
&ldquo;If we get stalled, make a break for it. Don&rsquo;t
worry about me. Once you get clear go directly
to the Department of Justice and report in
person to Waldo Edgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll have a better chance together,&rdquo; protested
Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. We&rsquo;ll go it alone,&rdquo; his uncle decided.
&ldquo;That will confuse them and one of us is bound
to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the radio secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to chance that. But remember
that you are the one they&rsquo;ll be after. Maybe
that&rsquo;s putting you on the spot, but I&rsquo;ve got to do
it now. It&rsquo;s our only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The headlights of the taxi showed the end of
the construction work. A smooth street was less
than 100 feet ahead of them, but Bob thought
the remainder of the distance they must go looked
even rougher than that portion of the street they
had negotiated so far.</p>
<p>He looked behind again. Several dim shadows,
the men chasing them, were dodging down the
street. He doubted if they were gaining now.</p>
<p>The taxi dropped into a deep rut and the engine
groaned. The driver shifted gears with a
clash that racked the entire car and the wheels
spun in the rut. Then they shot into reverse, but
the wheels couldn&rsquo;t climb out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stuck!&rdquo; cried the driver. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unloading.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>With a single motion of his hand he struck the
ignition switch and the motor, overheated and
steaming, sputtered and died. The headlights
also went out and Bob saw the now dim bulk of
the cab driver leap away from the car and vanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out, Bob. Duck and keep low. Make
for the side of the street. Here&rsquo;s where we separate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The order was accompanied by a firm shove toward
the door and then Bob was rolling in the
street, for he had missed his step and fallen. He
heard the door on the other side of the cab open
and knew that his uncle had made his escape at
least for the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXI</span></span>
<br />SHOTS IN THE NIGHT<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>The street was long, flanked by what appeared
to be warehouses, and there were
street lights only at the ends of the block.
For at least 400 feet in the middle there was no
light and it was in this dismal area that Bob and
his uncle were trapped.</p>
<p>A pile of construction materials offered the
first shelter for Bob and he ducked behind this.</p>
<p>From this shelter, he listened for some sound
from the men who had been pursuing them. He
did not have long to wait for sharp voices could
be heard a little further back along the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The taxi&rsquo;s stalled,&rdquo; someone said. &ldquo;Spread
out and let them have it if they make a break.
We&rsquo;ve got to get them to be sure we&rsquo;ll get the
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, behind the pile of construction materials,
heard someone pounding down the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>The beam from a flashlight shot through the
night and focused on the taxi driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap off that light!&rdquo; came a tense command.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only the driver. Let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bring the cops on us,&rdquo; came a sharp protest,
but the first voice came back tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him. We&rsquo;ll be out of here long before
he can get his nerve back and talk to the police.
Spread out, I tell you. We&rsquo;ve got to move fast.
If they break for the far end of the street we&rsquo;ll
see them under the street lights. There&rsquo;s no place
they can hide at each side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words confirmed Bob&rsquo;s fears. That
meant that there was no shelter in the buildings
which flanked the street. This time there was
no friendly hedge into which he could leap. He
would have been glad to have risked the barberry
thorns again if he had only had the chance.</p>
<p>The taxi was less than twenty feet away and
Bob knew that the men hunting for him and his
uncle would reach it in a few more seconds. Then
one of the first places where they would search
would be the pile of bricks and timbers behind
which he had sought refuge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Bob moved away cautiously, a plan of action
quickly forming in his mind. He would get as
far away as possible, then make some noise to
attract their attention. It seemed like a good
move for by concentrating their attention on
himself, he would provide an opportunity for
his uncle to slip away unnoticed and the radio
document could be delivered safely back to the
War Department.</p>
<p>Bob felt a nervous tension gripping his entire
body. It was as though the very night was alive
to the danger which filled the deserted street.
The pounding footsteps of the taxi driver gradually
died away and only Bob and his uncle and
three unknown pursuers were in the street.</p>
<p>A flashlight gleamed for a moment at the taxi
as the beam sought the interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing here,&rdquo; Bob heard someone mutter
as he backed away from the sheltering pile of
materials.</p>
<p>A piece of board crunched under his feet and
he stumbled and half fell to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; the exclamation was sharp and
commanding and a beam of light swung toward
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Bob forgot caution and scuttled away on his
hands and feet, dodging behind the piles of dirt
which had been heaped indiscriminately around
the street.</p>
<p>The flashlight seemed to be playing a game of
hide and seek with him, for not once did the beam
strike him and he found temporary shelter again
behind a pile of bricks.</p>
<p>But the sanctuary was not to last for long.
From the voices near the taxi, Bob knew that at
least three men were after them and as he listened
he heard a command that sent a chill racing along
his spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot unless you have to. But let them
have it if it looks like they&rsquo;re going to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob remembered that his uncle had a gun. That
was some consolation. He would have to depend
upon his fists for self protection and right
now both hands were sore and aching from his
encounter earlier in the day with the thorns of
the barberry.</p>
<p>The young federal agent crouched close to the
ground listening for some sound that might indicate
the whereabouts of his uncle. He only
knew that Merritt Hughes had dodged out the
other side of the taxi. Since then there had been
no sign or noise to reveal where he had sought
shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Bob strained his eyes, but the darkness in the
middle of the block was intense. Perhaps, after
all, that was a blessing for it gave them a better
opportunity to hide and made the task of the
searchers all the harder.</p>
<p>Impatient and cramped from hiding behind the
pile of bricks, Bob moved away. He was determined
to escape from the trap into which they
had fallen and he decided that by working his
way back along the street toward the car which
had been used by their pursuers might offer the
best avenue of escape.</p>
<p>A bold thought occurred. It might even be
possible to seize their car and make his own
escape.</p>
<p>Bob, crouching low, crept along the street, at
times almost crawling. It wasn&rsquo;t a pleasant task,
but he was steadily putting distance between himself
and the stalled taxi, where he knew the hunt
for his uncle and himself was being concentrated.</p>
<p>The young federal agent stumbled over a timber
and sprawled headlong on the dirt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>To Bob it sounded as though the noise of his
fall must have echoed and re-echoed along the
street. He remained motionless, almost breathless
on the ground, waiting for the pursuit to
swing toward him. But evidently the noise of
his tumble was not as great as he had feared and
the hunt continued near the taxi.</p>
<p>Bob continued his cautious advance toward the
car which had brought their pursuers. He was
not certain whether anyone had been left to
guard the machine and he moved carefully as
he neared the vehicle.</p>
<p>He was now at least 200 feet from the stalled
taxi, and he had no desire to give an alarm which
would bring the others swarming toward
him.</p>
<p>Bob now had decided what he would do when
he reached the car. In turning it about he would
race the engine, which would be sure to attract
the attention of the men seeking his uncle and
allow him to escape from the far end of the street.
There should be ample time for Bob to maneuver
the car about and get it started back down the
street before he could be overhauled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>The young federal agent was less than twenty
feet from the car, close enough to hear the soft
purring of its powerful engine, when a gun blazed
from behind him and the echoes of a shot resounded
between the buildings which flanked
the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXII</span></span>
<br />THE LONE STRUGGLE<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>All thoughts of escaping in the car vanished
from Bob&rsquo;s mind on the echoes of the
shot, which meant that his uncle had been
discovered, that he was a target for gunfire from
the guns of their pursuers.</p>
<p>The young federal agent swung about in his
tracks and started back down the street, stumbling
over the piles of debris as he raced forward,
forgetful now of any danger to himself and thinking
only of his chance to help his uncle protect
the precious paper which was in his possession.</p>
<p>From the vicinity of the stalled taxi cab guns
were barking steadily now and Bob paused.</p>
<p>The scarlet flashes marked the night and the
sharp reports from the guns rang back and forth
between the high-walled street. Bob counted
three guns in action, all directed toward a darker
mass near the far end of the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Then another gun joined in the fusillade, this
time from what apparently was a pile of debris
and from its heavy roar Bob knew that it was
his uncle&rsquo;s automatic.</p>
<p>Merritt Hughes, who had made his way cautiously
toward the far end of the street, had been
discovered just before he could make a final break
to safety. After the first shot from the guns of
his pursuers, he had taken refuge behind a pile
of bricks and concrete slabs, where he was ready
to make a determined resistance.</p>
<p>If he could stand off the attack for several
minutes, a swarm of police, attracted by the gunfire,
would descend upon them. But the men in
the street were shooting carefully and spreading
out, attempting to encircle him and force his surrender.
They were moving rapidly, dodging so
quickly that it was almost impossible to single
them out in the shadows or to flip an accurate
shot at them.</p>
<p>His ammunition was confined to the one clip
in his gun and a spare clip in his coat pocket. It
wouldn&rsquo;t last long in an encounter with three
gunmen and every shot must be made to count.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>A close shot, which struck a slab of concrete,
threw a fine cloud of dust into his eyes and
blinded him for the moment. He wondered about
Bob and whether he had been able to make his
escape. If he hadn&rsquo;t before this, now surely, with
all of the firing, he would be able to escape from
the street. Perhaps he would even be able to
lead the rescuing police which he felt sure would
come soon.</p>
<p>But Bob, at the other end of the street, had his
own ideas about the police and the need for a
hasty rescue.</p>
<p>He paused in his mad dash down the block.
Unarmed, he would be no match for the gunmen
who were attempting to surround his uncle
and obtain the paper.</p>
<p>A new plan formed in Bob&rsquo;s mind and he
turned determinedly and headed for the car.
It was a large and powerful sedan with a motor
under its hood that equalled the power of a hundred
and twenty horses.</p>
<p>There was no one in the car and Bob slid into
the driver&rsquo;s seat. The doors were unusually high
and heavy and he guessed that the car was bullet
proof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Bob reached for the headlight switch, then
thought better of it, and meshed the gears into
low. He tramped on the throttle and the motor
roared into action. With a lurch the heavy
car plunged off the pavement and into the street
which was undergoing repairs.</p>
<p>Bob would have liked to have used the headlights
for they would have revealed the menace
of hidden mounds of dirt and bricks and other
construction materials, but to have switched them
on would have made the car too easy a target for
the gunmen.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Bob saw the flashes of gunfire
cease, as though the men who had been pulling
the triggers were surprised and alarmed at the
approach of the car.</p>
<p>Then there was a spurt of flame and something
smacked hard against the windshield. He
saw the glass shatter, but it did not break, and
it gave him new confidence in the knowledge
that the car was protected against bullets.</p>
<p>Now there were more flashes of crimson ahead
of him and bullets spanked against the car. The
glass of a headlight shattered into a thousand bits.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>The big machine rammed into a pile of bricks
and stalled. They were only half way down the
block and Bob reversed quickly and backed the
car away. With a sharp flip of the wheel he
skirted the obstruction and once more roared
ahead, the car gaining speed as it went along in
second gear.</p>
<p>The roar of the motor was so loud that it
drowned out the explosions of the guns.</p>
<p>Bob, watching for some sign of his uncle,
thought he saw a form flit toward the side of the
street, but he couldn&rsquo;t be sure.</p>
<p>The car bounced in and out of a ditch, the
wheels spinning frantically and finally gaining
enough traction to send it ahead once more.</p>
<p>The windshield, which had been struck four
times, was a maze of shattered glass, and Bob
could see only dimly the light which marked
the end of the street. It was impossible to discern
anything ahead of him and he turned on
the headlights. It didn&rsquo;t matter much now, for
the car was too large a target to miss.</p>
<p>But the lights failed to come on. Some bullet
had probably clipped the wires, and Bob, his
hands wrapped around the steering wheel, hung
on grimly as the big car bounced along the uneven
street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>There was a jarring crash and the big car, its
wheels still spinning futilely, came to a stop. Bob
was knocked against the steering wheel and his
head reeled from the shock.</p>
<p>Dimly he heard someone jerk open the door
and he tried to rally his dulled senses and put up
a resistance, but a rough hand reached him and
seized him by the shoulders. He was conscious
that a light blazed suddenly in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the kid!&rdquo; cried the heavy voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
search him. Get the other guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was jerked from the car and dropped to
the ground. Once more the flashlight blazed,
this time shielded behind a pile of bricks, and
heavy hands went through his pockets.</p>
<p>As his head cleared, Bob realized his situation.
Resistance right now to the search might give
his uncle a few more precious minutes and Bob
suddenly doubled up his knees and aimed a heavy
kick at the man who was bending over him.</p>
<p>The maneuver caught the other unaware, and
he stumbled back against the pile of bricks. The
flashlight, dropping to the ground, went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a hand, over here! The kid&rsquo;s busted
my flashlight,&rdquo; called the man Bob had kicked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Then it felt as though a ton of beef had suddenly
been dropped on him for the man who
had captured him was trying to make sure that
Bob would not squirm away from him. Just to
make sure, he fell heavily on the young federal
agent and Bob cried out in pain as the breath
was forced from his lungs.</p>
<p>From the distance came the shrill siren of a
police car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry it up, over there,&rdquo; a voice called.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to make a break out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get the other guy?&rdquo; demanded the
man who was almost smothering Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the echo of those words there came a shot
and a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob attempted to throw off his assailant, but
a thousand stars seemed to descend upon him,
police sirens mixed in with roaring motors and
blazing guns and in spite of his efforts he dropped
into a jumbled sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXIII</span></span>
<br />ANXIOUS HOURS<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Mixed sounds penetrated through a maze
of pain which filled Bob&rsquo;s head when
he finally started to regain consciousness.</p>
<p>First of all there was the noise of police sirens
which seemed to fill the night air with their
shrieks.</p>
<p>Bob managed to raise himself up on one elbow
just as a car careened around the corner and
screeched to a stop. Men fairly poured from
the car and Bob could see that each was heavily
armed.</p>
<p>Lights gleamed in the disrupted street and Bob
turned to look for the car which he had commandeered
and from which he had been so
roughly jerked. It had vanished and only the
damaged taxi remained.</p>
<p>The echo of the gunfire had died away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>A beam of light focused on Bob and a sharp
command followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment Bob ached too much to care
whether he ever moved. Someone came up from
behind him and jerked him roughly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snap a pair of handcuffs on this bird. We&rsquo;ll
question him later.&rdquo; The command was from
an officer who seemed to be in charge of the
squad. From back down the street more sirens
shrilled and Bob saw two more cars pull to a
stop and officers unload hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me explain,&rdquo; protested Bob. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
only look in the case inside my coat you&rsquo;ll find
my identification papers. I&rsquo;m a provisional
federal agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the police laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine story. You&rsquo;re only a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was tired and worried now about his uncle.
Hot tears of anger welled into his eyes and his
voice trembled as he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take the time to make sure before
you handcuff me. A federal agent has been
kidnaped on this street and you&rsquo;d better hunt
for him instead of wasting your time on me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who was kidnaped?&rdquo; the question was asked
by a newcomer who had joined the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle, Merritt Hughes,&rdquo; replied Bob.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the Department of Justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe there is something to his story,&rdquo;
chimed in another officer. &ldquo;I know there is a
federal agent by the name of Hughes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better start looking for him. He
was down at the end of this street a couple of
minutes ago, the target for three gunmen. We
were trapped here in the taxi that&rsquo;s deserted over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get busy, boys, and see what you can find,&rdquo;
ordered the sergeant who was in command of
the squad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this boy down to the corner
and we&rsquo;ll phone the Department of Justice and
check up on his story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the police detail spread out to comb
the street, the sergeant and Bob walked back to
the police car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will go hard on you, kid, if you&rsquo;re trying
to pull anything on us,&rdquo; warned the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; Bob reassured him.
&ldquo;Just let me get to a telephone where I can get
in touch with Waldo Edgar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>They walked to the corner and then turned
to their right. Half way down the next block
there was a small drug store and they found a
pay telephone there. Bob entered the booth
while the sergeant, a blocky, dark-haired man of
about 40, stuck his foot in the door so that it
would remain open and he could hear the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand me your papers,&rdquo; he told Bob, and
the young federal agent handed over the small
leather case which he carried in an inner pocket.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s fingers skimmed the pages of the telephone
directory until he found the desired number.
Dropping a nickel in the phone, he dialed
for the Department of Justice. When an operator
answered, he gave his message quickly and
concisely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you Mr. Edgar at once,&rdquo; promised
the operator.</p>
<p>It was only a few seconds later when Bob
heard the voice of the chief of the division of
investigation of the Department of Justice. It
was a rich full voice, that once heard would never
be forgotten. Bob identified himself quickly and
then in rapid sentences told what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle had the paper the last you saw of
him?&rdquo; asked the federal chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;He was attempting to
reach the far end of the street and escape while
I attracted the attention of the men trying to capture
him. But I was knocked out and I don&rsquo;t
know what happened. When the police arrived
the street was deserted and the bullet-proof sedan
was missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spread an alarm at once,&rdquo; said Edgar.
&ldquo;See that you are released at once by the police.
Then come here at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob turned to the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied about my identity?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; grinned the sergeant, handing
back the leather case, which Bob slipped into his
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be over at once,&rdquo; he promised the federal
chief.</p>
<p>He stepped out of the booth and started to
hasten toward the door, but a question from the
sergeant detained him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give us a description of that car?
We&rsquo;ll have it broadcast over the police radio
and also on the teletype circuit. Some of our
men may pick up the machine and the sooner
we can get a report the better chance we&rsquo;ll have
of finding your uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s description of the car was meager. He
wasn&rsquo;t even sure of the make, but it had looked
like a large Romney sedan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The windshield is shattered and there ought
to be a number of bullet marks on the body,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I guess that will be the best way to
identify it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll shut down on every road out of the
city. They can&rsquo;t get away,&rdquo; promised the sergeant,
as he stepped back into the booth to telephone
the description to police headquarters.</p>
<p>But Bob had his own doubts as to whether the
police would be able to apprehend the car. Too
much time had elapsed. Even now the big machine
might be speeding out of the city.</p>
<p>It was then that Bob disobeyed his orders from
the federal chief. Instead of summoning a taxi,
he hastened back to the street where the attack
had taken place. He wanted to be sure that his
uncle had not been wounded and left there.</p>
<p>When he arrived the police squad had completed
its search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Find anyone?&rdquo; asked Bob anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even a good ghost,&rdquo; grumbled one of the
officers. &ldquo;Say, that taxi&rsquo;s a wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bob had no time to waste in talk over a
damaged taxi. He half ran and half walked to
the nearest thoroughfare where he flagged a taxi
and ordered the driver to take him to the Department
of Justice building.</p>
<p>On the way over, Bob reviewed the events
of the night. With the disappearance of his
uncle the case had deepened and he felt as though
he was drifting in a sea of puzzling problems.</p>
<p>On reaching the Department of Justice building,
Bob went directly to the upper floor where
the federal chief&rsquo;s office was located. An agent,
evidently watching for him, escorted him into
the inner office and Bob&rsquo;s eyes widened as he saw
Condon Adams and Tully Ross seated beside
Waldo Edgar&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>The federal chief rose as Bob came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a chair, Bob. We want to hear in detail
everything that went on tonight. Now that
your uncle has disappeared, you&rsquo;ll have to work
with Adams and Ross here on the case. I&rsquo;m
counting on you for a lot of good work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXIV</span></span>
<br />A SOLITARY HAND<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob, as he eased his weary body into a chair,
looked at Condon Adams and Tully Ross.
Both of them looked tired and worn and
their faces reflected the strain they had been
under since the escape of the prisoner from the
police station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some more bungling, I expect,&rdquo; snapped
Condon Adams. The words were harsh and uncalled
for, and Bob&rsquo;s temper flared quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was bungling, it wasn&rsquo;t the first bit of
it today,&rdquo; he shot back at the older federal agent.</p>
<p>Adams&rsquo; face flushed. He started to reply,
then thought better of it, and remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know everything in detail, Bob,&rdquo;
said the federal chief. &ldquo;Just tell me all that happened
this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were eating dinner,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;when I
happened to put my hand in my coat pocket and
I felt a paper in there. When I pulled it out and
discovered what it was, I was dumfounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dumb-bell!&rdquo; The word was whispered, but
everyone in the room heard it and Bob whirled
toward Tully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another crack like that out of you and I&rsquo;ll
take you all apart,&rdquo; he flared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down, boys,&rdquo; said Waldo Edgar.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get facts and get them at once.
A man&rsquo;s life may be hanging in the balance. Go
on Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob went on to describe the start of their trip
to the Department of Justice building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw a car following us, but we were holding
our own until we turned into a street where
there was a lot of repair work going on. Our
taxi driver tried to get through, but the cab became
stalled and he took to his heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob paused a moment. The recent action in
the street was so vivid that it was hard to describe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Merritt and I decided it would be better
to try to make it alone and we parted just
as these gunmen unloaded. I managed to crawl
back to their car and when they started shooting
at Uncle Merritt I took their car and rammed it
down the street in an effort to attract their attention
and give him a chance to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any chance that he got away?&rdquo; asked
the federal chief, leaning forward anxiously in
his chair.</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing I remember was a single shot
and then someone cried, &rsquo;We&rsquo;ve got him.&rsquo; Then
someone slugged me and I didn&rsquo;t regain consciousness
until the police arrived. They haven&rsquo;t
found a trace of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid that was the case,&rdquo; said the federal
chief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve swung a tight cordon around the
entire city and I&rsquo;m even having the airports
checked. We won&rsquo;t overlook a single angle.
Something will turn up before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone buzzed and the federal chief,
seized it eagerly, but his face fell as some routine
message came over the wire.</p>
<p>When he had completed the conversation, he
turned toward Condon Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that Merritt Hughes is off the case,
you&rsquo;ll be in direct charge of finding him and recovering
that paper. I&rsquo;m assigning Bob to give
you some help wherever you need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Adams showed his displeasure, but he was
careful not to make it too obvious to Waldo
Edgar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he granted. &ldquo;I may need the kid
for some leg work, but he always seems to be
getting into trouble.&rdquo; It was biting sarcasm, but
Bob chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This latest development,&rdquo; went on the federal
chief, &ldquo;puts us right back where we were after
we thought the paper had vanished from the
office, while in reality it was in Bob&rsquo;s pocket.
The one prisoner who could have given us some
information slipped out of our hands and one of
my best agents has been abducted. That means
whoever is after this information is both desperate
and daring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal chief looked at Bob, whose face
was still flushed from the recent fight in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a gun, Bob?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a .32.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not heavy enough,&rdquo; he summoned an
assistant, who returned shortly with a stubby but
serviceable gun and two clips of cartridges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a new gun with which we are equipping
our agents,&rdquo; explained Edgar. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a .45
and when you hit anything with that, you stop
it, even if it is a freight train. You can&rsquo;t afford
to go rummaging around Washington at night
without ample protection while you&rsquo;re on this
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far I&rsquo;ve been able to make pretty good
use of my fists,&rdquo; grinned Bob, &ldquo;but this may come
in handy in a pinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any orders for Bob tonight?&rdquo; asked Edgar,
directing his question at Condon Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need him,&rdquo; was the tart reply. &ldquo;He
might as well go home and get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may get a little sleep, but I&rsquo;m not going
home,&rdquo; replied Bob. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too popular with
certain unpleasant people. You can find me at
a hotel and I&rsquo;ll probably change my address every
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He named a small hotel which was near his
own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said Waldo Edgar, &ldquo;but
be sure to keep us informed every time you shift
to a new address. We&rsquo;ll let you know the minute
we get any information on your uncle. Now
you&rsquo;d better get home and get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Bob admitted that he was mighty tired, but
he was far from sleepy for his mind was still
spinning in circles.</p>
<p>When he left the office Condon Adams and
Tully Ross stepped out into the hall with him
and they descended to the main floor in the same
elevator. Bob could feel the cold wave of animosity
which engulfed the others and he knew
that though they would make every effort to recover
the radio secret, they probably would not
overtax their energies in finding his uncle.</p>
<p>As they walked toward the main door, Condon
Adams spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call on you when we need help, but
this thing is going to be easy. Too bad your
uncle muffed it this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob wheeled and faced him squarely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have an understanding right now. In
the first place, my uncle didn&rsquo;t muff anything.
I&rsquo;d like to have seen you do any better than he
did when three gunmen were shooting at you in
a dark street and the only escape was at an end
where there was a brilliant street light. Now as
far as getting things in a mess, it seems to me that
you did a perfect job when you let that prisoner,
the one man who could have supplied valuable
information, take your gun away from you in
the police station this afternoon. That makes
you out to be quite a chump and I&rsquo;ve always
thought you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was surprised at his own words and his
own boldness, but he saw a look something like
apprehension in Condon Adams&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like my uncle; you never have.
You&rsquo;ve always been jealous of his brains and his
ability. Your nephew doesn&rsquo;t like me. Well,
that goes for me, too. I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll make
any effort to find my uncle. If you can recover
that paper, well and good&mdash;that&rsquo;s your first
thought. But I&rsquo;m serving notice on you right
now that I&rsquo;m going to find him and I&rsquo;m going
to recover that paper. And I&rsquo;ll do it without
any help from either one of you. So here&rsquo;s a
tip. I&rsquo;m tired and I&rsquo;m mad and I don&rsquo;t like you.
Right now I can think of nothing I&rsquo;d like to do
better than give each of you a biff on the nose
and if you open your mouths again about my
uncle, I&rsquo;ll do just that thing. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s words had so amazed both Adams and
his nephew that they were speechless and the
young federal agent turned and stepped through
the main doorway.</p>
<p>Tully Ross, angry words crowding to his lips,
started to follow Bob, but the firm hands of Condon
Adams stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your head, Tully,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;The
boy&rsquo;s mad clear through and he&rsquo;d do just what
he said&mdash;clean up on both of us. Maybe we&rsquo;ve
got it coming, though. We baited him too much.
But we&rsquo;re going to find that missing radio document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same resolution was in Bob&rsquo;s heart as he
stepped down the avenue, but in addition was
the grim determination that he would find his
uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXV</span></span>
<br />THE FIRST CLUE<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>The coolness of the fall night helped to
clear the mad whirl of Bob&rsquo;s fatigued
mind and he mulled over the things that
had happened as he walked down the avenue.</p>
<p>For nearly 24 hours the missing paper had
been in his possession, which accounted for the
attempt to kidnap him. But how had it leaked
that the paper had been sent over to the archives
division for filing&mdash;who had known that he would
be alone that night?</p>
<p>Bob felt that knowing the answer to this question,
he would have something on which to base
his further investigation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Then there was the disappearance of his uncle
that night. Bob knew that both the radio document
and the federal agent were in the hands
of ruthless and relentless men. From what his
uncle had told him before, the radio secret was
worth a huge amount to almost every foreign
power and he dared not guess what country
might be interested in obtaining its possession
through such means as had been employed.</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s walk took him to the archives building
and he automatically turned in and went up to
the office where he worked.</p>
<p>The guard on duty on that floor was a familiar
one, and Bob spoke to him briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything unusual tonight?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; was the quick and honest reply.</p>
<p>Bob walked down the corridor, unlocked the
door of the office, switched on the lights, and
stepped inside.</p>
<p>The room appeared to be just as he had left
it in the afternoon and Bob sat down at his desk.
It was quiet here and he would have an opportunity
to think out some of his problems.</p>
<p>But he found himself too tired even for that.
His head was heavy and he drowsed at his desk.
Half an hour passed and Bob fell into a sound
slumber. For an hour he slept at his desk until
the tapping of the guard at the door aroused him.</p>
<p>Bob opened the door in response to the summons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought something might have happened to
you,&rdquo; said the guard, half apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something did,&rdquo; smiled Bob. &ldquo;I went sound
asleep. I&rsquo;d better get out of here and get to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the guard looked on, Bob turned off the
lights, locked the room and started toward the
elevator.</p>
<p>The guard halted him a few paces down the
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Mr. Houston, but I&rsquo;ll have to search
you. There&rsquo;s a new rule that anyone working
on this floor out of hours must be searched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob was half inclined to be angry, but he
realized the soundness of this rule, especially after
what had just taken place. He quietly submitted
to a careful search of his clothing by the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know your job,&rdquo; said Bob when the
search was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to be a store detective,&rdquo; replied the
other, with not a little pride in his voice, &ldquo;and
if I do say it myself, I was one of the best in
Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only a few blocks to the hotel at which
Bob had decided to take up temporary quarters,
and he walked the short distance at a brisk pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>He registered, asking for a quiet, inside room,
but the clerk looked dubious when Bob informed
him he had no baggage, but would arrange to
have his clothes sent down in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pay in advance,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Bob delved into his pockets in search of money
and to his embarrassment found that he had less
than a dollar.</p>
<p>The clerk appeared skeptical. It was late and
after the fight in the street Bob&rsquo;s clothes were in
none too good condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d better try another hotel,&rdquo; he
suggested.</p>
<p>By that time Bob longed for nothing more
than a comfortable bed and a few hours of sleep
and his feet were heavy. They wouldn&rsquo;t have
carried him another block.</p>
<p>Reaching inside his coat he pulled out the billfold
and drew out the identification badge which
had been given to him by the federal chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess this will identify me, even though
I&rsquo;m temporarily short of funds,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Now
I want that room and I don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed
unless there is something really important.
Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>The clerk stared at the identification card and
his whole manner changed into one of the utmost
courtesy. In less than ten minutes Bob was in
bed, to drop into a sleep that was to be disturbed
hours later by the strident ringing of the telephone
on the stand beside his bed.</p>
<p>It was broad daylight when Bob rubbed the
sleep from his eyes and answered the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Bob Houston speaking,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The words which came over the wire caught
and held his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand. Of course, come right
over. I&rsquo;ll be dressed and ready to go over the
entire affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob hung up the receiver, reached the bathroom
in one long jump, and in another had the
shower on and was under it.</p>
<p>After a brisk shower, he rubbed his body
down thoroughly, feeling ready for what he
knew was to be a busy day. The caller was
Lieutenant Frederick Gibbons of the intelligence unit
of the War Department, who had been assigned
to help on the case. He had promised Bob information
of vital importance and almost before
Bob had finished dressing there was a knock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>When Bob opened the door a trim, soldierly
figure was standing in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Gibbons?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. I take it you&rsquo;re Bob Houston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about breakfast?&rdquo; asked the intelligence
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready now and hungry,&rdquo; grinned Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll eat and talk. The coffee shop
downstairs is excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had placed their orders for breakfast,
Lieutenant Gibbons leaned toward Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been asleep?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been nearly three o&rsquo;clock before
I went to bed here,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a lot of things have happened since you
dropped out of this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has my uncle been found?&rdquo; asked Bob
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but he hasn&rsquo;t. However, we&rsquo;ve
turned up some clues that may prove mighty
interesting. The car in which he was abducted
has been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; The question was sharp and anxious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Down near the tidal basin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any trace of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a stain or two on the rear cushions
of the car, but nothing serious, so if he was
wounded last night, I don&rsquo;t think we need to
worry about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the tidal basin? Does that mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Bob left the question unfinished, the
lieutenant guessed what he feared and was quick
to ease his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your uncle is still a captive. We&rsquo;ve
learned that sometime late in the night a high-speed
motor boat dashed out of the basin and
down the Potomac. It was a strange boat that
came up the river early in the evening. We&rsquo;ve
a fairly good description of the craft and may
be able to trace it down. Now our first mission
is to locate your uncle and recover that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob liked the manner in which Lieutenant
Gibbons spoke. The intelligence officer looked
keen and alive to everything. He was a little
taller than Bob and slender with a slenderness
that was wiry. His eyes were a sparkling brown
and there was an upward twist to his lips that
Bob liked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard whether Condon Adams and
Tully Ross have turned up anything?&rdquo; asked
Bob.</p>
<p>A frown marred the lieutenant&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been busy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As a matter
of fact, they&rsquo;ve caused the arrest of Arthur
Jacobs. They found some rather suspicious
looking things at his apartment, including some
half burned scraps of paper in a fireplace in which
someone was offering Jacobs $5,000 for information
on the radio secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it look like a real lead?&rdquo; Bob was anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may, but I hate to believe it. Jacobs is a
foreigner and he has a brother who only recently
escaped from a midwestern prison and who has
made a bad record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does his description tally with that of the
fellow who escaped from jail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. There is a real resemblance
and Condon Adams says he is certain that Jacobs&rsquo;
brother, Fritz, is the man who escaped from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Adams is too anxious to build up a
case,&rdquo; said Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but the facts are starting to click
and it looks like the Jacobs brothers are going to
be in for some unpleasant hours. Arthur is down
at the central station now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible. I&rsquo;ve known him
for a long time; he didn&rsquo;t seem like the kind who
would get involved in anything like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just when you lose your way,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take anything for granted. If you
want to succeed in intelligence work you have
to put a question mark around everyone.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c26"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXVI</span></span>
<br />A BREAK FOR BOB<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Breakfast at an end, they left the hotel and
the intelligence officer hailed a taxicab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down and listen in on this
grilling,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Bob didn&rsquo;t relish seeing Arthur Jacobs, his
filing chief, under the barrage of questions he
knew Condon Adams would hurl at the little
man, but he steeled his nerves for he knew that
in his new work he must be willing and prepared
to face many an ordeal.</p>
<p>They found a small group in a plain room.
There was none of the pictured &ldquo;third degree&rdquo;
methods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Arthur Jacobs looked worried and tired. He
sat behind a table, a pitcher and glass of water
within easy reach. Lounging across the table
from him was Adams, his fingers drumming incessantly
on the table. At another table at one
side sat a stenographer and Tully Ross was sitting
in a chair tilted back against the wall.</p>
<p>Just after Bob and the intelligence officer arrived,
Waldo Edgar looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any results?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far,&rdquo; grunted Condon Adams, &ldquo;but
this fellow has a story to tell and he&rsquo;s going to
break pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of desperation flickered for a moment
in Arthur Jacobs&rsquo; eyes and he turned toward
Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Jacobs,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;d ever see you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was just a trace of a smile around the
filing chief&rsquo;s lips when he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought I would be here, Bob. Who&rsquo;s
in charge of the office with both of us away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ll find out if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the filing chief simply and Bob
stepped into an adjoining office and telephoned
the archives division, where he was informed
that a senior clerk from another office had taken
over the duties temporarily.</p>
<p>When Bob stepped back into the larger room,
Jacobs was sweating freely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all right at the office,&rdquo; volunteered
Bob, who felt sorry for the little man.
&ldquo;Bondurance, from the next office, is taking
charge and they&rsquo;re getting along all right. Of
course they miss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t get those papers back
in the proper order. It&rsquo;s an awful mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob agreed that it was and he couldn&rsquo;t make
himself feel that Arthur Jacobs, so obviously
worried about the routine at the office, could be
guilty of anything very bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, now Jacobs,&rdquo; broke in the heavy
voice of Condon Adams. &ldquo;Quit this stalling
and get down to business. How much did you
get for selling out this secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you I didn&rsquo;t get anything,&rdquo; replied
the filing chief, spreading his hands out on the
table in a dramatic denial. &ldquo;How many times
must I tell you this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until you tell me the truth and admit that
you were paid to sell information on a government
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go away; quit bothering me,&rdquo; cried the
man behind the table.</p>
<p>He stood up and pointed at Adams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get out! Get out! Leave Bob here I&rsquo;ll
talk to him; I can trust him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Condon Adams half rose in utter surprise at
the force of Jacobs&rsquo; words. Then he dropped
back into his chair and a look of sullen resentment
swept over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me, or no one,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>But from the back of the room, where he had
stepped in unnoticed, Waldo Edgar spoke quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Jacobs talk in his own way,&rdquo; he ruled.
&ldquo;The rest of us will step out while Bob talks with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legs of the chair in which Tully Ross
had been leaning back against the wall struck the
floor with a thud and Tully started to protest,
but his uncle, realizing the futility, waved him
into silence.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gibbons grinned at Bob as the
others left the room. He was the last to step out
and he closed the door carefully behind him.</p>
<p>When they were alone a tremendous burden
seemed to lift from the shoulders of the filing
chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to talk,&rdquo; he told Bob, in a voice so
low that it would have been impossible for anyone
at the door to hear. &ldquo;But I had to talk with
someone I could trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle is missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was kidnaped last night,&rdquo; replied Bob.
&ldquo;There were three in the gang and they got him
and the radio paper which was stolen from our
file.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Jacobs nodded sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about that, Bob, for he is in great
danger then. I&rsquo;ll tell my story as quickly as I
can; then you must act without loss of time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXVII</span></span>
<br />ACTION AHEAD<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Arthur Jacobs wiped the perspiration from
his forehead and then reached for the
glass of water. He drained it at one gulp
and leaned back in his chair, an air of relief on
his face.</p>
<p>Bob, tense, waited for him to speak. When
the words finally came they rushed out in a torrent
and Bob heard a story that wrenched at his
own heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been terrible, Bob, terrible. I&rsquo;ve got to
tell you the whole story. When Fritz escaped
from prison he made his way east and I had letters
from him. He needed money; he had always
needed money as far as that was concerned.
When I sent word that I had none to spare, he
started threatening me. Then he fell in with bad
company and the first thing I knew he was here
in Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>The filing chief paused a moment and wiped
his forehead again for the perspiration was running
freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fritz came to my apartment and demanded
money, but I actually didn&rsquo;t have it. He went
away for a while, and then came again later. It
was on this visit last week that I got some inkling
of what was in his mind. He started hinting
around about the secrets which passed through
my hands for filing and for safe-guarding. After
an hour or so he came out in the open and made
me a proposition. He knew where he could sell
the secret of this new radio-propelled and guided
plane if I could get my hands on the War Department
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The filing chief stopped to pour out another
glass of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; urged Bob, who was desperately
anxious to learn the full story and then resume
the hunt for his uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fritz offered me $5,000 for my share if I
would only tell him when the papers reached the
office. He said that was all they needed to know.
I could have used the $5,000, but I told him I
wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing. Then a couple of days
later I got a letter from him. It was mailed somewhere
over in Maryland and he repeated his offer
and threatened me with exposing an old family
scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the letter Condon Adams found,&rdquo;
exclaimed Bob, and the filing chief nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was careless about that. I tossed it in the
fireplace, but didn&rsquo;t make sure that it had been
consumed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you supply your brother with the
necessary information?&rdquo; asked Bob, pressing hard
for more concrete information.</p>
<p>Arthur Jacobs lowered his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fritz came back the other night. He was
in a terrible rage. He had promised to get this
information from me, and had failed. You&rsquo;ll
never know the fear I&rsquo;ve always had of Fritz. He
was bigger, older and he always bullied me. He
threatened to beat me to death and I finally told
him what he wanted to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob saw tears welling into the chief clerk&rsquo;s
eyes and he turned his own face away, for it had
not been easy to hear this confession. When the
young federal agent finally looked back, Arthur
Jacobs was composed and calm once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When did you give him this information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the night before you caught Fritz in
the office,&rdquo; replied Jacobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him since then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he came to my apartment after his escape
and I sheltered him for a few hours. I didn&rsquo;t
want to, but he was armed and forced me to do it.
That&rsquo;s all I know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who&rsquo;s behind Fritz? Who
is supplying him with the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arthur Jacobs shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even see any money,&rdquo; he said bitterly.
&ldquo;Fritz said that would come later after this thing
had been forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob felt sorry for the little man, for he knew
now that Jacobs had been the unwilling dupe
of an older and bullying brother.</p>
<p>There was one bit of information Bob must
have, one thing that was vital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you save the envelope in which the letter
Fritz sent you from Maryland was mailed?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Jacobs ran his fingers through his thinning hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you toss it in the fireplace?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. I probably dropped
it in the wastebasket. The maid cleans my apartment
each day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where would this type of rubbish go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down to the janitor, who would burn it in
the incinerator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob reached for the telephone on the other
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the number of your apartment
house,&rdquo; he urged, and Jacobs supplied the needed
information.</p>
<p>The building superintendent answered and
Bob&rsquo;s words fairly tumbled over the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Bob Houston, a federal agent speaking,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Get hold of your janitor at once.
Don&rsquo;t allow him to burn any more waste paper
or refuse of any type from the floor on which
Arthur Jacobs lives. I&rsquo;ll be there within half
an hour to check up on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The building superintendent was inclined to
argue, but Bob cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time for words,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do as
you&rsquo;re told or I&rsquo;ll file a charge against you for
interfering with the work of a federal officer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Actually Bob didn&rsquo;t know whether he had
that power or not, but the words sounded well
and the threat did what was intended&mdash;the superintendent
changed his tone and agreed to halt the
burning of any more wastepaper or refuse.</p>
<p>Bob turned back from the telephone and Jacobs
looked at him with a brighter face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen to me,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I feel better for having told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you all I can,&rdquo; promised Bob heartily,
turning to call for Lieutenant Gibbons.</p>
<p>The intelligence officer opened the door almost
instantly and Condon Adams and Tully Ross
crowded in close behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, can you solve the mystery for us now?&rdquo;
asked Adams, his voice heavy with sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. Solve it in your own way. Remember
that I&rsquo;m working with my uncle on this
case. You have the invaluable help of Tully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of smart cracks like that,&rdquo; replied
Adams, his face flushing a little. &ldquo;I want
to know what Jacobs said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making my report direct to Mr. Edgar.
You&rsquo;ll have to get it from him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>With that Bob left the room and went directly
to the office of the federal chief, Lieutenant Gibbons
trailing at his heels.</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar listened intently while Bob recounted
what Jacobs had told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather sensed what his story would be,&rdquo;
mused the chief investigator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, every word of it. Just another case of
an older and bullying brother taking advantage
of a weaker one. It looks like Jacobs has supplied
us with the key information we have been groping
for. Good work, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t deserve any congratulations.
Adams turned up Jacobs as a suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough, but Jacobs would never have
talked for Adams or any of the rest of us. The
important thing is that he did talk to you. Now
what are you planning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob told of the letter from Maryland and of
his orders to the building superintendent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The postmark on that letter should give us
a clue to where the gang took my uncle,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much chance of finding it, but it&rsquo;s
worth the time and effort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Waldo Edgar&rsquo;s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to do, my boy. It&rsquo;s things like
that that count. You never can tell when even the
tiniest slip of paper is going to give you the key
to the case you&rsquo;re working on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief agent turned to Lieutenant Gibbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re staying on the case with Bob?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try and keep up with him,&rdquo;
smiled the intelligence officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid. Then we&rsquo;ll expect your uncle and
the missing radio paper within the next twenty-four
hours, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXVIII</span></span>
<br />WASTE PAPER<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>There was a real feeling of hope in Bob&rsquo;s
heart as he stepped out of the Department
of Justice building with Lieutenant Gibbons
at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are going to move fast from now on,&rdquo;
predicted the lieutenant. &ldquo;By the way, Bob,
aren&rsquo;t you a little young to be a federal agent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a full-fledged agent,&rdquo; explained Bob.
&ldquo;When my uncle was assigned to this case and
it looked like some valuable information might
be gained by an inside man in our office, I was
delegated to help him and given papers as a provisional
agent. If I make good on this case I
may get into the service permanently, even
though I&rsquo;m a little young.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re going in with a rush and I
know you&rsquo;re going to make good even though
Edgar gave you a pretty short time when he said
you&rsquo;d have the case solved within twenty-four
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what scares me,&rdquo; confessed Bob, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ve got to find my uncle. Once he&rsquo;s safe I&rsquo;ll
start worrying about the radio secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you find him you&rsquo;ll recover the radio
secret,&rdquo; predicted the intelligence officer.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes of fast driving in a taxi took
them to the apartment where Arthur Jacobs resided.</p>
<p>The building superintendent, curious and
somewhat worried over Bob&rsquo;s telephoned orders,
was waiting at the door to meet them.</p>
<p>Bob identified himself and the superintendent
admitted them to the building, taking them into
the basement where an incinerator bulked in the
background. Beside it were a number of bales
of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been baling and selling the waste
paper,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t tell you in what
bale the paper from the fourth floor, where
Jacobs lives, can be found. It&rsquo;s a good thing you
phoned. We were going to have this trucked out
sometime during the day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Bob looked at the bales and a feeling of dismay
crept into his heart. All he wanted was one
envelope&mdash;a small slip of paper&mdash;yet there were
literally hundreds of pieces of paper in each one
of the bales. He turned to Lieutenant Gibbons.
The intelligence officer grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re in for it. Better get off your
coat, Bob, and we&rsquo;ll start on the first bale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you want to open up all those
bales?&rdquo; demanded the building superintendent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; nodded the intelligence officer.
&ldquo;We not only want to, but we&rsquo;re going to do it.
Get some snippers and cut through the wires on
this bale.&rdquo; He indicated the huge stack of paper
nearest him.</p>
<p>The superintendent snapped on additional
lights and grudgingly cut the wires on the first
bale while Bob took off his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save every envelope with a Maryland postmark
on it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It looked like an endless task, but Bob and the
lieutenant, squatting on their heels, started
through the pile of paper.</p>
<p>The building superintendent, after watching
them for several minutes, joined in the hunt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>At the end of half an hour they had found
four letters with Maryland postmarks on them,
but none of them addressed to Arthur Jacobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to have more help,&rdquo; decided the
intelligence officer when an hour had slipped
away and they had gone through only one bale.
He went to a telephone and called the Department
of Justice, with the result that within half
an hour six other agents were on the job, delving
through the growing pile of papers.</p>
<p>By noon they had examined every scrap of
paper from five bales and their arms and backs
were aching sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dizzy,&rdquo; confessed the intelligence officer
when they finally stopped for lunch. Leaving
one of the agents to guard the bales in the basement,
the others went to a nearby restaurant.
Lunch was eaten quickly and with a minimum
of talk, for every one of them knew that perhaps
a man&rsquo;s life hinged on the quickness with which
they could find the tell-tale envelope.</p>
<p>They carried a tray of lunch back to the agent
who had been left on guard and plunged once
more into the mountainous task which still faced
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>The early hours of the afternoon slipped away.
Bale after bale of paper was scanned with care
and Bob felt his hopes sinking.</p>
<p>Another bale was finished and one more pulled
down and clipped open. He knelt down again
and picked up a handful of waste paper. An
envelope drew his attention, but it was for another
resident on the floor on which the filing chief
lived.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gibbons, whose lanky form was
almost doubled in a knot from the hours of bending
down and looking at slips of paper, suddenly
straightened up with a triumphant cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the letter!&rdquo; he cried, waving a badly
torn envelope.</p>
<p>The federal men, dropping the paper they had
been sorting, rushed to his side.</p>
<p>Bob was the first to see the postmark on the
envelope. It was marked from Rubio, Maryland,
and was addressed to Arthur Jacobs.</p>
<p>The handwriting on the envelope was large
and heavy and the pen which had been used was
none too good for it had dropped ink in two
places on the envelope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Bob felt his heart leap. This was the clue they
had sought for so many weary, back-breaking
hours in the litter of paper in the basement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to Rubio?&rdquo; Bob asked the intelligence
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I even know what part of
Maryland it&rsquo;s in, but I believe if we go by plane,
we should be there in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go by plane,&rdquo; decided Bob.</p>
<p>Just how he could obtain a plane was a question
he couldn&rsquo;t have answered at the moment,
but he was determined to make the trip with the
least possible loss of time for he felt that either
in Rubio or near it he would find the solution to
the mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXIX</span></span>
<br />INTO THE AIR<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>Bob and Lieutenant Gibbons left the other
federal agents at the apartment building
to help the superintendent clean up the
litter of paper they had strewn about the basement
while they hastened back to the Department
of Justice building.</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar himself was waiting for their report
and he smiled contentedly when he heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the right track, Bob. Follow it
hard and don&rsquo;t let a single trick get away from
you. How are you going to Rubio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob turned to a wall map which showed the
entire state of Maryland. As Lieutenant Gibbons
had surmised, Rubio was on the east shore, a tiny
dot of a town, well isolated from any of the other
shore villages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a desolate stretch,&rdquo; said the chief.
&ldquo;You may need help in rounding up this gang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it alone,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;If we find
them, we can send in a call for assistance. Can
you arrange for us to fly there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief of the division of investigation
looked at his watch. It was just three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plane will be ready in half an hour at
Antacostia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Make sure that you are
well armed and don&rsquo;t take unnecessary risks.
Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then start for Antacostia at once. You&rsquo;re
going, too, lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss this,&rdquo; replied the intelligence
officer. &ldquo;Besides, we have a considerable stake
in this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid. But don&rsquo;t let Bob take any needless
risks. I&rsquo;m counting on his developing into
one of my aces one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob&rsquo;s temperature rose about three degrees
and he looked at the federal chief to see if he was
joking, but Waldo Edgar was serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me like you&rsquo;re making headway
rapidly,&rdquo; said Lieutenant Gibbons as they left
the Department of Justice building. &ldquo;You carrying
a gun?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Bob patted his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a special .45 with an extra clip of
cartridges. That ought to be enough for a trip
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; said the intelligence officer.</p>
<p>When they reached Antacostia, a cabin plane,
a navy ship, was out on the ramp waiting for
them. It was an amphibian and while they were
paying the driver of their cab, the pilot started
the motor with a roar that shook the ground.</p>
<p>An officer ran toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one of you is Bob Houston?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Bob stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted on the phone at once,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step on it, Bob. We&rsquo;re ready to go,&rdquo; warned
Lieutenant Gibbons.</p>
<p>Bob ran toward the administration building
and a clerk there handed him a telephone.</p>
<p>Bob recognized instantly the voice of the chief
of the bureau of investigation. Waldo Edgar,
usually so calm, was deeply moved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bob, get to Rubio with all possible speed.
We&rsquo;ve just had reports that an unknown yet
tremendously powerful radio station has just
come on the air. The Department of Commerce
has had radio direction finders on it for the last
ten minutes and they report that the station must
be on the east shore of Maryland, probably near
Rubio. They&rsquo;re throwing on extra power on
their experimental station here to gum up the
sending from this unknown outfit. I&rsquo;m afraid
they&rsquo;re trying to get the secret of the radio-controlled
plane out of the country in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all ready to go. The plane&rsquo;s on the
ramp now with the motor on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then hurry. Let me know the minute you
land at Rubio and I can send more information.
I&rsquo;m starting agents out of Baltimore by motor
and I&rsquo;ll send another plane with men within the
hour. Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob turned and raced toward the waiting plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; asked Lieutenant Gibbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you when we&rsquo;re in the air,&rdquo; replied Bob.</p>
<p>They climbed into the cabin and were no
sooner seated than the ship started rolling across
the field.</p>
<p>Almost before they knew it the ground was
dropping away and they were headed for the
east shore of Maryland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXX</span></span>
<br />ON THE EAST SHORE<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>The air that fall afternoon was clear and
the entire panorama of the city of Washington
spread out below them. But
Bob&rsquo;s thoughts were not on the beauties of the
afternoon or of the flight. His mind was centered
far ahead on the east shore village of Rubio
and what he might learn there.</p>
<p>The cabin was well insulated, so Bob and Lieutenant
Gibbons could converse in comparative
ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Edgar have to say?&rdquo; asked the intelligence
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid the gang is trying to get the secret
radio information out of the country by using
an unlicensed station which has just started broadcasting
from somewhere along the east shore of
Maryland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gibbons whistled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Federal agents are being sent from Baltimore
by motor and another plane is to follow us within
a few minutes. The Department of Commerce
believes the station is near Rubio and they&rsquo;re trying
to gum up the broadcast as much as possible.
Oh, it all clicks beautifully. My uncle was taken
down the river in a fast boat and landed somewhere
near Rubio. He had the paper they
desired and now they are trying to send the information
someplace in Europe by using this powerful
but unlicensed radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds logical,&rdquo; agreed the lieutenant.
&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re going to have some busy hours
ahead of us. Made any plans yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought any beyond getting to
Rubio as fast as we can and trying to learn there
whether a boat like the one which slipped out
of the tidal basin last night has been sighted
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we can swing it alone or are you going
to wait for the other agents to catch up with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no hesitation in Bob&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going on as rapidly as we can. Every
minute counts now. We may run straight into
a whole kettle of trouble, but we&rsquo;ll have to handle
it in some fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lapsed into silence as the sturdy amphibian
sped out over Chesapeake Bay. Fishing
boats could be seen below and several freighters,
bound for Baltimore, churned up a white wake
in the blue of the bay. It was indeed a calm and
peaceful afternoon but Bob&rsquo;s mind was anything
but peaceful or calm.</p>
<p>Then they were over Maryland and a few
minutes later the uneven line of the east shore
was visible.</p>
<p>The pilot, in his cockpit up ahead, was scanning
the ground intently. The ship veered a
little to the right and they circled over a sprawling
village before which a broad, sandy beach
broke the gentle swell of the Atlantic. Half a
mile from the village proper was a sheltered cove
with a score of small fishing wharfs. It was
toward this that the pilot of the amphibian nosed
his craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>As they swung over the cove Bob could see
the upturned faces of fishermen as they stared
at the unexpected visitor. Bob looked at the
boats in the cove with extreme care, but none
of them were unusual and none appeared capable
of great speed.</p>
<p>The amphibian smacked the water and spray
flew out on both sides as they slowed down and
taxied in toward the shore. The pilot cut the
engine when they were near a low wharf and
dropped a light anchor.</p>
<p>A friendly fisherman put out in a dory and
pulled alongside the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any trouble?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Lieutenant Gibbons, &ldquo;but
we&rsquo;re looking for a black speed boat. It&rsquo;s been
described as about 30 feet long and capable of
40 miles an hour. It&rsquo;s a cabin boat with an antennae
above the cabin. Ever seen anything
like it around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob, watching the fisherman closely, thought
he detected a slight narrowing of the other&rsquo;s eyes,
but he knew that the men of the east shore were
by nature extremely cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;ve seen just that boat,&rdquo; replied
the fisherman, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a good many
crafts slip around the coves here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boat would have come in this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better climb in. We&rsquo;ll ask some of the other
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob and the intelligence officer seated themselves
in the dory and were quickly put ashore,
where a little group gathered about them.</p>
<p>The man who had brought them ashore acted
as spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These fellows are looking for a speedboat
that might have come around here this morning.
Anybody seen anything of such a craft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no immediate reply and Bob could
see doubt as to the wisdom of answering the question
in the eyes of a number of the men. It was
then that he decided to tell them the importance
of their visit.</p>
<p>He drew out his billfold and handed the nearest
man his identification card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re federal officers,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;re looking for a man who was kidnaped last
night in Washington in a speedboat and brought
somewhere near Rubio. If you can give us any
information it may save a man&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire attitude of the group changed and
a young man who had been in the background
stepped forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw such a boat just about mid-forenoon,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;It was coming up from the south, and
coming fast, maybe forty an hour, but I didn&rsquo;t
see it put in any place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A radio in one of the fishing shacks screeched
as though in agony and the owner of the set
hurried away to tune it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody ought to break that thing up; it&rsquo;s
been doing that all afternoon,&rdquo; grunted another
fisherman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it work all right before?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But this afternoon something went
wrong and we can&rsquo;t get anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob knew then that the end of the trail was
nearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me this: Are there any old estates near
here which have been recently occupied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owner of the radio, who had shut it off,
rejoined the group in time to hear Bob&rsquo;s question,
and it was he who replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the old Haskins place about five miles
up the shore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been around
there for the last month or so. I went up one
day to try and sell some provisions, but they
ordered me off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could this speedboat have been bound for
the Haskins place?&rdquo; asked Bob, aiming his question
at the young fisherman who had told him
about the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it was going up the shore. But I&rsquo;ve
never seen that boat around here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bob turned to Lieutenant Gibbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me like the Haskins place is our
goal. Let&rsquo;s reconnoiter it in the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; agreed the intelligence
officer.</p>
<p>Bob swung back to the fishermen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Federal agents are coming in here from Baltimore
by car and from Washington by plane. If
they arrive before we return, direct them to the
Haskins place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXI</span></span>
<br />THE CHASE ENDS<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>With its motor on full, the amphibian
flashed across the cove and wheeled
into the air. Bob felt that they were
on the last leg of their hunt and he sensed a
tenseness of his whole body that was unsettling.
Lieutenant Gibbons realized how Bob felt and
he leaned over and spoke to the young federal
agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let your nerves loosen up a little and keep
your head when we get on the ground. If we get
in a jam, use your gun only as a last resort. Remember
that help will be along soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intelligence officer took out his own automatic
and examined it, making sure that the firing
mechanism was working perfectly. Bob did
likewise and shifted the gun into his right-hand
coat pocket. He knew that with the gun there
he could shoot through his pocket if necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>The village of Rubio dropped behind them and
a desolate stretch of shore unfolded before their
eyes.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gibbons was the first to sight
the Haskins place, a rambling old structure well
out on a neck of land that projected into the
Atlantic. He signalled to the pilot that this was
their destination and the naval airman banked the
amphibian gracefully.</p>
<p>The plane dropped low, flying not more than
a hundred feet above the shore. The expansive
old house, which had several long wings, was
badly in need of paint, as were the outbuildings
clustered to the rear. A long, low boathouse was
built as a part of the run-down pier and one door
was closed, but as the plane flashed by Bob caught
a glimpse of a black motorboat and his heart
leaped. He seized Lieutenant Gibbons&rsquo; arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a boat in the shed!&rdquo; cried Bob. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get down as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But already the flyer was dropping the amphibian
low. They spattered down on the water
and their speed dropped off as they neared the
old wharf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Bob watched the house closely for some sign
of life. The windows, many of them broken,
betrayed no movements. From all outward appearances
the house had not been occupied in
years.</p>
<p>The amphibian, now less than 50 yards from
the beach, lost headway and drifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like some bad rocks ahead,&rdquo; said the
pilot. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare get any closer. You&rsquo;ll have
to swim if you want to land here unless I taxi out
and down a ways. It looked better further
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bob had no intention of wasting any more
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going ashore,&rdquo; he told Lieutenant Gibbons.
&ldquo;You can stay here and see if anything
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the intelligence officer could protest,
Bob eased himself out of the cabin and started
swimming for shore. In a few yards he was able
to touch bottom, but just as he straightened up
there was a sharp puff from one of the lower
windows of the old house and a bullet ricocheted
along the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Bob, acting by instinct, ducked and started
swimming under water. He should have been
greatly alarmed, but instead he felt a strange exultation
for the firing of that shot had told him
what he wanted to know&mdash;he was at the end of
the trail.</p>
<p>The young federal agent came up for air and
as soon as his head appeared, three shots sounded
in rapid succession, each fired from different
windows in the house.</p>
<p>Two of the bullets went wide of their mark,
but the third splashed water in Bob&rsquo;s eyes. Before
he ducked again he heard Lieutenant Gibbons
firing back and then another gun joined in
the battle and Bob knew that the naval flyer had
taken a hand in the party.</p>
<p>Swimming with a powerful stroke, Bob shot
along under water. When he came up this time he
was in the shelter of the boathouse. He was able
to stand erect and he waved back to Lieutenant
Gibbons. The firing from the house had suddenly
ceased and Bob made his way alongside the
squat, powerful speedboat.</p>
<p>He climbed into the craft and with several
well aimed blows with the butt of his gun disabled
the ignition apparatus. At least the kidnapers
would not escape in the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>From some place behind the house the sound
of an automobile exhaust roared out and Bob
leaped to the door of the boathouse. A car
wheeled around the far corner of the house and
he saw three men inside, two in front and one in
the rear. It was the first time Bob had ever fired a
gun with a human being as a target, but he fired
rapidly from the automatic and it seemed to him
that a whole volley of bullets issued from the
weapon in his hands. Then the gun was silent
and before he could get the other clip from his
pocket the car had disappeared.</p>
<p>Bob started running for the house, pausing
only once when a cry from Lieutenant Gibbons
caused him to turn his head. The intelligence officer
was wading ashore and motioning for Bob
to wait for him. But Bob had more pressing
duties.</p>
<p>The front door of the house was half open and
Bob charged through. The interior was dusty
and unkempt, although there were some signs
that an effort had been made to live in two of the
front rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Lieutenant Gibbons pounded up the front
steps and burst into the hallway. He joined Bob
and together they resumed the frantic search of
the house. The first floor was combed, room for
room and closet by closet, and it was not until
they reached a shed at the back of the house that
they found what they were seeking. There, laying
on a roll of dirty bedding, was Merritt
Hughes, bound, gagged and with a red welt
along one side of his head.</p>
<p>Bob, a cry of joy at finding his uncle on his
lips, bent down to untie the gag while Lieutenant
Gibbons slashed at the rope which fastened the
federal agent&rsquo;s wrists and ankles.</p>
<p>Together they helped Merritt Hughes to his
feet. His tongue was badly swollen from the gag,
but he managed to say a few words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they get away?&rdquo; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll get far. Agents
are on their way from Baltimore and Washington,&rdquo;
said Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about their radio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Department of Commerce heard them
come on the air and gummed up their broadcasts,&rdquo;
replied Bob.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Lieutenant Gibbons, who had gone in search
of water, returned with a tin cup and Merritt
Hughes drank it with relish, taking slow, deep
draughts of the refreshing liquid.</p>
<p>Then he bathed his face and hands and felt
much refreshed. He looked quizzically at Bob
and the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows may catch pneumonia running
around here in wet clothes,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to your head?&rdquo; demanded
the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They creased me with a bullet during the
scrap back in Washington last night,&rdquo; replied the
federal agent grimly. &ldquo;I want you to see their
radio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led them to the top floor of the old house
where one room had been fitted up for broadcasting
purposes. Bob knew little about radio, but
he could tell that a great deal of money had been
expended here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the aerial?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They used an underground antennae,&rdquo; replied
his uncle.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gibbons picked up a heavy chair
which was in the room and deliberately smashed
the delicate equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the end of this station.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t recovered the radio document,&rdquo;
groaned Bob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think we have,&rdquo; replied the lieutenant,
pointing from a window to a cavalcade of
cars which was approaching through a clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Chapter XXXII</span></span>
<br />&ldquo;FEDERAL AGENT&rdquo;<br /><span class="smaller">&#9733;</span></h2>
<p>The scene that night in the office of the
chief of the bureau of investigation was
one that would remain stamped forever
in Bob&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar was there. So was Bob&rsquo;s uncle
and on the other side of the room were Tully
Ross and Condon Adams and in the background
Lieutenant Gibbons chuckled occasionally.</p>
<p>It was a brief session with Waldo Edgar doing
most of the talking in that close, clipped manner
of speech of his which inspired his own agents
and instilled fear in the hearts of the men he was
pursuing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reports you have turned over to me tonight
are highly gratifying,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I think
we can call this case completed. While most of
the honor of the final catch goes to Bob Houston,
Condon Adams and Tully Ross deserve credit
for uncovering that vital clue in the fireplace of
Arthur Jacobs&rsquo; apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>The federal chief shuffled through some papers
on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the men involved in the case have been
apprehended, including Fritz Jacobs, who appeared
to be the ringleader. Their radio station
has been destroyed and they were unable to make
use of the information which they had for nearly
24 hours. You may be sure that their punishment
will be swift and sure. As for Arthur Jacobs, I
am inclined to feel sorry for him for his record in
the government service up to this time had been
excellent and I will do all that I can to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Waldo Edgar turned to Tully Ross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a result of your work on this case, I am
pleased to be able to tell you that you are now a
full fledged federal agent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief of the bureau of investigation then
faced Bob and he smiled warmly as he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To you, Bob, I extend my most sincere congratulations.
You were under a great strain, yet
you used your head every minute of the time and
when the showdown came, you were in there
fighting. I don&rsquo;t know when anything has
pleased me more than to hand you your commission
as a federal agent. You&rsquo;re young, but I
predict that as Agent Nine you are going a long
ways in the federal service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of himself, tears welled into Bob&rsquo;s eyes
for his heart was overflowing with happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to make good,&rdquo; he promised.
&ldquo;When do I go on another case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waldo Edgar chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better rest a
day or two from this one. There will be plenty
for you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was, indeed, a wise prophet, for in less than
24 hours Bob was to get the call that was to send
him out on the famous Jewel Mystery, about
which you will learn in &ldquo;Agent Nine and the
Jewel Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
